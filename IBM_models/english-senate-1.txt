visitor in the Gallery 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , I would like to introduce a distinguished guest in our gallery : 
senators ' STATEMENTS 
his WORSHIP , MR. PIERRE BOURQUE 
mayor of Montreal 
hon. Marcel Prud ' homme : 
honourable senators , I thank you for so kindly welcoming the mayor of the oldest French city in North America , the pillar of Quebec . 
a number of senators will recall a great Senate personality , above all a great French Canadian from Quebec , the late Jean Marchand . 
he was a member of Parliament , a cabinet minister , a senator and a Senate Speaker . 
he said - and it remains true - that Montreal was the economic heart of Quebec and that if Montreal was on track , Quebec was on track and if Quebec was on track , it was happy . 
and if Quebec was happy , Canada could only do well . 
we must remember these words . 
you will recall that I requested permission to say a few words the day after the election , but as there were several senators wanting to speak , I delayed my statement . 
in a sense that is just fine , because today , instead of talking about him , I can introduce him to you . 
he is someone who really understands the important role of the city . 
i was glad that he met with the Prime Minister of Canada today . 
he also met with the Honourable Martin Cauchon , the Honourable Sheila Copps and others . 
Mr. Bourque has an excellent rapport with the public . 
you will recall the press all predicted last May that he would not be re - elected . 
he had 13 per cent in May and ended up winning with 44.2 per cent . 
yet , there are still those who say he does not have a clear mandate . 
Mr. Mayor , with your 44.5 per cent , you can go forward . 
all the senators from Montreal , Conservatives and Liberals alike , together with the members of Parliament , support you and want to work together to make life easier in Montreal . 
i repeat : - 
if Montreal is happy , Quebec will be happy , and if Quebec is happy , Canada will be happy . 
national Day of Remembrance 
ninth Anniversary of Tragedy at l 'É cole Polytechnique 
hon. Joyce Fairbairn : 
honourable senators , this is the ninth anniversary of an act of violence against women that was so shocking and tragic that it has become a symbol for action across this country ever since . 
the Montreal Massacre , as it is called , occurred on December 6 , 1989 , an ordinary day as students attended their classes and socialized in the cafeteria at l 'É cole polytechnique . 
the normalcy of their lives was shattered by an individual so unhinged by his own problems that he took a semi - automatic rifle into a classroom , separated out the men and , proclaiming his hatred of feminists , he gunned down 14 young women . 
he killed himself as he ended their hopes and their dreams for the future . 
once again , we quietly recall their names : 
behind those names are the families and friends who will never forget , joined by women and men who will gather this weekend at ceremonies across the land to reinforce a commitment to break the violence in our society . 
the sad legacy of these young women is now the National Day of Remembrance and action on violence against women . 
as always , we look to the statistics , hoping they will be improved but knowing that they still remain distressingly high - statistics about sexual , psychological and physical abuse , and violence , assault , harassment , stalking , murder . 
women of all ages , from children to elders , are constant targets for violence . 
we have enacted gun control ; we have stiffened many penalties under the law ; we have set up protective homes ; we have raised awareness through every medium of education , but clearly we have fallen far short of changing the attitudes and the social and economic conditions that foster fear , insecurity and desperation which , in turn , breed anger and violence . 
honourable senators , this is not just a women ' s issue . 
it is important that all of us in this chamber , women and men together , use every opportunity offered by our privileged positions to support solutions and force change . 
our only tolerance must be zero tolerance against all forms of violence in what we like to think of as a caring and compassionate country . 
those 14 young women , honourable senators , would be telling us to cut the excuses and get on with the job . 
hon. Senators : 
hear , hear ! 
hon. Shirley Maheu : 
honourable senators , this Sunday will be the ninth anniversary of the deaths of 14 young women , cut down in the prime of life at Montreal ' s É cole polytechnique . 
for many of us , December 6 is a day to reflect upon violence against women . 
today , honourable senators , we shed a tear in remembrance as we think about these young women who will never have a chance to fulfil their dreams , and the hopes and dreams of their parents , because their lives were cut short so abruptly and brutally . 
i would ask you to join with me in expressing to the families and friends of these young victims our compassion and sorrow , coupled with the hope that this act of remembrance will help educate the public , and lead one day to the eradication of such acts against women .

question PERIOD 
solicitor General 
treatment of Protestors at APEC Conference by RCMP - Possibility of Referral of Subject - Matter to Senate Committee - Government Position 
hon. No ë l A . Kinsella ( Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , last night on CBC ' s The National Magazine program , University of Ottawa Law Professor Ed Ratushny stated : 
the accountability of the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister ' s Office , if it ' s not within the mandate of the commission , it certainly is within the mandate of Parliament . 
therefore , will the Leader of the Government not agree to the suggestion made by my colleague Senator Carney , that the Senate inquire into those matters that are clearly outside the scope of the RCMP Public Complaints Commission ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , as I have stated , there is already a process in place to inquire into the APEC events in Vancouver . 
the government has full confidence in the RCMP Public Complaints Commission . 
the commission is an independent body over which the government has no control . 
even if it wanted to stop the inquiry , the government does not have the authority to do so . 
we have received varying opinions on this subject . 
senator Kinsella has cited one that was given on a CBC program last night by Professor Ratushny . 
but there is another opinion which I received recently . 
i will read a few paragraphs of a letter , a copy of which I would be happy to table . 
perhaps the Leader of the Opposition already has a copy of the letter . 
it states , in part : 
dear Mr. Graham : 
re : 
RCMP Public Complaints Commission Hearings Into the Events Surrounding the November 1997 APEC Meetings 
in recent weeks , there have been calls for Parliament to halt the RCMP Public Complaints Commission ( PCC ) hearings into events surrounding last year ' s Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) conference and replace them with a judicial inquiry . 
the B.C. Civil Liberties Association ( BCCLA ) is opposed to such action . 
they go on to give a number of reasons , all of which I will not read . 
senator Carney : 
read some . 
senator Graham : 
if honourable senators agree , I will be happy to table the letter . 
the letter goes on to state : 
as a complainant before the current PCC hearings , the BCCLA is especially concerned with discovering the truth about these allegations . 
however , because of the many delays , some people have given up hope that the PCC is still capable of bringing this truth to light . 
indeed , one complainant has called for the resignation of hearing panellists in the hope that this will force the government to appoint an independent judicial inquiry . 
the BCCLA does not share this view . 
while we have been critical of some aspects of the PCC hearing process , including the lack of legal funding for complainants , we are equally concerned with what may happen should the PCC not be allowed to complete its task . 
if the PCC is not permitted to continue its hearings , this would not only signal to the public its lack of ability to investigate events surrounding APEC , it would also serve to undermine the important role that the PCC plays more generally as a mechanism for effective civilian oversight of the RCMP . 
it is important to remember that the PCC hearings have a predominantly fact - finding role . 
a wealth of evidence has been assembled and 120 witnesses will be called - 
i presume among them will be the Prime Minister ' s Chief of Staff and the former director of operations . 
- to testify under oath about the events last Fall and be cross - examined on their testimony by lawyers , including those acting for the BCCLA . 
it is clear that the PCC has the mandate and the will to complete its task . 
in our view , PCC hearings have several advantages over other forms of investigation : 
in the interests of brevity , I will skip the points they raise there . 
the letter then goes on to state : 
in addition , there is little reason to think that abandoning the current process in favour of a judicial inquiry would result in matters being dealt with more quickly or more thoroughly . 
a judicial inquiry would be subject to the same sorts of challenges and legal manoeuvring as is the PCC . 
to abandon the current process in the face of delay would , in the future , encourage any party to a Commission process which had extensive legal resources and which was concerned about a possible negative outcome , to use its resources to derail this process . 
they feel so strongly about the issue that , in the concluding paragraph , they say : 
... should a court decide that the current PCC panel is unable to continue , we favour the immediate appointment of a new panel to hear our complaints . 
it should not be up to the government of the day , or the RCMP , to decide when and how such complaints are to be investigated . 
in short , we have unfinished business with the PCC , and we are not prepared to stand idly by and see this process derailed . 
the letter is signed by Andrew Irvine , President . 
my copy indicates that it has been forwarded to the RCMP Public Complaints Commission . 
senator Carney : 
senator Graham : 
Kim Campbell , Andrew Coyne , Gordon Gibson , Mike Harcourt , Rafe Mair , Svend Robinson , and David Suzuki , among many other outstanding Canadians . 
with the permission of the Senate , I would be happy to table this letter . 
some Hon. Senators : 
hear , hear ! 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , is leave granted to table the document ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
senator Kinsella : 
honourable senators , I am glad that we now have at least one document on this tragedy in this chamber . 
where should I begin ? 
perhaps I should begin with other parts of the letter . 
for example , the last paragraph on page 2 helps to paint the association ` s great concern about relying on the RCMP Public Complaints Commission , which is the best game in town for them . 
why ? 
because they are fearful of a judicial inquiry . 
what do they say ? 
furthermore , on the next page , they state : 
unlike a judicial inquiry which may be stopped prematurely by the government of the day - as was the Somalia inquiry - ... 
one can understand why this particular complainant , which will appear before the Public Complaints Commission , would not want to go the route of a judicial inquiry . 
the Honourable Leader of the Government drew our attention to the fact that Mr. Svend Robinson is one of the patrons of the association . 
i wish to tell honourable senators and the Leader of the Government in the Senate that we had the MacDonald Royal Commission into the RCMP wrongdoing in the 1970 s . 
whilst that commission was ongoing , the House of Commons Justice Committee went forward and heard from witnesses . 
indeed , there is the El - Mashat affair . 
in the words of the current Minister of Foreign Affairs , who will be here later this afternoon - and , perhaps this will remind him of what he said in 1991 - will we get at the truth or not ? 
if we did not wait for Parliament to become involved then , although commissions and other fora were dealing with the matters of abuse , why are we waiting now ? 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , I am merely suggesting that we ask that due process be followed with both the Public Complaints Commission and the Federal Court . 
there are several matters before the Federal Court . 
i have full confidence in both bodies , and I would certainly not want to circumvent the important work that they have to do . 
hon. David Tkachuk : 
honourable senators , I have two supplementary questions . 
i think a lot of members on this side understand it , but I do not . 
is the Leader of the Government in the Senate saying that the RCMP inquiry into the APEC affair has the right to call witnesses who work for ministers of the Crown to ask them about their role in this matter ? 
senator Graham : 
Yes. 
honourable senators , in my opinion , they have that right . 
senator Tkachuk : 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , that would be up to the body that was making the inquiry and was charged with that responsibility , depending on the mandate of that particular commission . 
the mandate of the Public Complaints Commission , which I outlined the other day and I repeat , is to inquire into all matters relating to these complaints . 
senator Tkachuk : 
therefore , honourable senators , in some cases they do and in some cases they do not , depending on what the government feels they should or should not do . 
is that correct ? 
senator Graham : 
No. It depends on the mandate . 
hon. Pat Carney : 
honourable senators , should the Leader of the Government in the Senate be correct in his interpretation , of course we would honour it . 
however , should the minister be wrong in his interpretation and the Public Complaints Commission declares itself unable to deal with these political matters of political staffs and political direction , would the Leader of the Government in the Senate commit , on behalf of the government , to supporting hearings by the Senate into this issue ? 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , it would be presumptuous and hypothetical for me to try to judge what may happen in the future . 
however , we would certainly be prepared to deal with the matter at that particular time . 
hon. Ron Ghitter : 
honourable senators , I have a supplementary question . 
in that the Leader of the Government in the Senate places such emphasis on the letter that has been tabled today , would he also agree with the following portion of the letter : 
as the attached documents show , there is also strong prima facie evidence to think that the PMO is not a neutral party in these proceedings . 
these documents have been culled from the thousands of pages of evidence that have been tabled before the PCC . 
we believe that they are relevant to our complaints since they lend support to the view that fundamental free speech rights of Canadian citizens may have been compromised , and that there may have been improper attempts on the part of the PMO to use the RCMP to advance political objectives . 
in that the Leader of the Government in the Senate seems to agree with everything else in the letter , does the minister also agree with that paragraph ? 
senator Graham : 
senator Ghitter : 
honourable senators , I have one final supplementary question . 
is it then agreed that if the Prime Minister is asked to appear to give testimony , he will appear ? 
senator Graham : 
that would be up to the Prime Minister . 
national Defence 
vintage of Labrador Helicopter Fleet - Possibility of Leasing Replacement Aircraft to Undertake Search and Rescue Missions - Government Position 
hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
honourable senators , I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate . 
he will have noted the grounding of additional helicopter aircraft , this time because of faulty screws that could be catastrophic were they to wind up in the engines of those helicopters . 
yesterday , honourable senators , the minister said that the oldest part contained in the Labradors is the number plate and that is not 35 years old . 
it is a wonder sometimes that the Leader of the Government in the Senate believes everything that he reads in his briefing book . 
does the Leader of the Government truly believe that this is the case ? 
will he not admit that the airframes of those helicopters , the ribs , the substantial undercarriage , are the original design , part of the original aircraft , and that they are technology from the 1950 s ? 
will he not admit that those planes are too old to be flying ? 
i would ask the honourable leader to respond to that comment . 
it is nonsense to say such things if he is not prepared to back them up . 
in particular , he should not say such things if he does not know what he is talking about , because that can mislead people . 
could the Leader of the Government in the Senate shed any further light on the suggestion that the Minister of National Defence and the government are actively considering the leasing of equipment to replace the Labradors , until such time as they have either grounded those aircraft and put them to rest forever , or we have new equipment ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , the number to which I was referring was the serial number . 
we remain confident that we can perform search and rescue missions with current Canadian Forces assets . 
senator Forrestall : 
what does that mean ? 
senator Graham : 
however , as I have said , if additional resources are required to carry out search and rescue missions , the government and the Department of National Defence would be prepared to entertain a range of options , including leasing . 
senator Forrestall : 
i am not sure , honourable senators , what all of that gobbledegook is about , except evasiveness and a disproportionate and out - of - whack suggestion that no one gives a damn about the men and women who fly this equipment . 
i doubt very much that that is what the Leader of the Government in the Senate is suggesting . 
can he not tell us whether the government is considering leasing equipment ? 
five of the twelve helicopters are now grounded , and two others should be grounded . 
chances are that one will ground itself permanently , and that will be the end of someone . 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , following the incident involving the Labrador in Fredericton , where a screw was ingested by the engine , all Labrador squadrons have been sent an inspection notice to check the screws in question as part of the ongoing airworthiness program . 
in the opinion of the officials at National Defence , there is no reason to ground the Labrador fleet . 
the incidents reported over the last few weeks involve specific and localized problems that can be fixed . 
i repeat what I said in my previous answer , namely that leasing is one of the options that is being examined by the military at the present time . 
hon. Gerry St. Germain : 
this business of having things under consideration , honourable senators , is fine . 
it is an honourable intention . 
however , I believe the information that is available to Canadians and to the Armed Forces and everyone else indicates that this is not a time for intending to do something ; we have arrived at the point in time when we must do something . 
i asked the minister yesterday if he would approach his cabinet colleagues , in particular the Minister of National Defence , and determine whether they will actually lease . 
it is not a question of intention . 
these pilots are out there , and they must take passengers and crew up with them when they go on these rescue missions . 
it is not only their lives that are at stake , it is also the lives of their passengers . 
this undermines their confidence , their ability to perform their tasks in the way that they should be performed , and their ability to perform the search and rescue missions in the way that they should be performed . 
senator Forrestall is trying to obtain a definitive " yes . " 
when there is a flagrant situation such as this one , I believe that it is incumbent upon all senators to ask the government and the cabinet to give us a definitive answer , especially in view of the gravity of the situation . 
senator Graham : 
first , the possibility of leasing is under consideration . 
i discussed this matter with the Minister of National Defence as recently as this morning . 
second , the decision to restore the Labrador fleet to full operational availability was made by the Chief of the Defence Staff . 
full operational availability means that the fleet is available for search and rescue operations but proficiency training and all non - essential flying are kept to the absolute minimum . 
inadequacy of Labrador Helicopter Fleet to Undertake Search and Rescue Missions - Accountability of Minister for Possible Resulting Future Loss of Life - Government Position 
hon. Brenda M. Robertson : 
as a supplementary , honourable senators , my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate . 
are ministers of the Crown responsible for their departments , " yes " or " no " ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
Yes. 
senator Robertson : 
thank you . 
the government has placed the responsibility of flying those Labradors squarely in the hands of the pilots , the crews , and their families . 
in my opinion , that is not good enough . 
government has a responsibility to the people of Canada for ensuring that the military has safe equipment , and that Canadians have a national search and rescue service . 
the Leader of the Government in the Senate has assured us that the Labrador fleet is safe , and that there are adequate resources for search and rescue . 
in the event of another fatal crash of a Labrador and / or death due to the lack of search and rescue capability or readiness , which minister of the Crown is responsible ? 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , I respect Senator Robertson a great deal , but I do not think anyone wishes to address the tragedies that occurred and lay them at the door of one individual , no matter what position they hold in the country . 
the ultimate responsibility lies with the Minister of National Defence . 
that is the chain of command . 
the decision to restore the Labrador helicopters to full flying capability was made by the Chief of the Air Staff , and he reports to the Chief of the Defence Staff . 
the buck stops , I assure you , with the Minister of National Defence , and he is prepared to take full responsibility . 
senator Robertson : 
i understand the line of command . 
heaven help us if we have another accident , or more lives are lost at sea . 
in that line of command , the way you stated it , do I hear another opportunity for the government to blame someone else down the line ? 
senator Graham : 
indeed not . 
there are chains of command , most particularly in the Armed Forces , and they are followed carefully . 
if there is any department of government where the chain of command is followed , it is certainly in the Department of National Defence . 
the Minister of National Defence , who has an outstanding record in Canada in all of the many offices he has held , is not one who would want to duck his particular responsibility . 
we are taking every precaution to avoid any kind of tragedy from recurring . 
we talked yesterday about the sad circumstances that surrounded the crash of the Labrador helicopter in Quebec early in October . 
senator Lynch - Staunton is mumbling about who cancelled the helicopter contract . 
senator Lynch Staunton : 
i am trying to restrain myself . 
senator Graham : 
he is trying to say that the present government cancelled the contract . 
however , I wish to remind you that even if the present government had gone forward with the particular contract which the previous government had proposed , those aircraft would still not be delivered until late next year . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
now it is four more years . 
hon. Gerry St. Germain : 
honourable senators , the Leader of the Government in the Senate is trying to pass the responsibility down to the Chief of the Air Staff . 
senator Graham : 
senator St. Germain , may I correct you ? 
i did not say that the Chief of the Air Staff has the responsibility for leasing . 
the Minister of National Defence and the government have that responsibility . 
i did not make that suggestion at all . 
senator St. Germain : 
yes , but you are making the suggestion that it is the Chief of the Air Staff ' s decision that determines whether these airplanes will fly for not . 
senator Graham : 
that is correct , but the final responsibility rests with the Minister of National Defence . 
senator St. Germain : 
what you are trying to do , with all due respect , is put the responsibility on the Chief of the Air Staff , which is totally unfair . 
it is unfair to the ranks below because we know what has happened in the military over the last few years . 
the responsibility lies with the minister , and the minister should be making those decisions , and making them immediately , because if there are more lives lost , the responsibility will belong to the minister and to the cabinet . 
senator Graham : 
in all fairness , Senator St. Germain , I do not want to have your remarks misinterpreted by anyone in this chamber , or by the public at large . 
i did not at any time suggest , first , that the Chief of the Air Staff was responsible for making a decision on leasing , or second , that the Minister of National Defence was ducking his responsibility - not at all . 
Mr. Eggleton is an honourable gentleman who has an outstanding record in our country , and he is an outstanding Minister of National Defence . 
senator Robertson : 
as a supplementary , honourable senators , the Leader of the Government in the Senate mentioned that even if the present government had not cancelled the order for helicopters placed by the previous government , they still would not be available , and we well understand that . 
some Hon. Senators : 
hear , hear ! 
senator Robertson : 
will this government act in the same manner ? 
senator Graham : 
those honourable senators who have followed the course of the actions that have been taken by this government will know that a replacement for the Labradors has been ordered . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
why did you cancel the order in the first place ? 
hon. Eric Arthur Berntson : 
i have a supplementary . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
i regret , honourable senators , that the time for Question Period has expired . 
senator Berntson : 
your Honour , I have a supplementary . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
i am sorry , honourable senators . 
the rule says that Question Period will last for 30 minutes , and the 30 - minute period has expired . 
senator Berntson : 
i ask for leave , honourable senator , to extend Question Period . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , is leave granted ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed .

hon. Eric Arthur Berntson : 
honourable senators , a couple of supplementaries ago , my honourable colleague the Leader of the Government in the Senate suggested that the Department of National Defence was actively pursuing the goal of 100 per cent availability of the Labrador fleet for the purposes of search and rescue . 
in the same sentence he said , however , that proficiency flying will be kept to a bare minimum . 
has the question occurred to anyone as to why proficiency flying , for all intents an purposes , will not take place ? 
it is likely because the aircraft are not considered to be safe . 
if they are not considered to be safe for training and proficiency flying , how can they possibly be considered to be safe for search and rescue purposes ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , as I said , that is a decision that has been taken by the Minister of National Defence on the advice of those who report to him . 
senator Berntson : 
honourable senators - 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , leave was granted for one question . 
that is what I heard . 
senator Berntson : 
it was for supplementary questions . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
that is the basis that I heard for the giving of leave . 
that is the statement I heard . 
business of the Senate 
extension of Question Period - Point of Order 
hon. No ë l A . Kinsella ( Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I rise on a point of order . 
leave was requested to extend Question Period . 
his Honour understood that leave was for only the one question to be posed by the Honourable Senator Berntson . 
it was our understanding that leave would also be inclusive of two other senators who had stood , including Senator Oliver in particular . 
i noted that the Leader of the Government in the Senate nodded , so I took it that he and I were in agreement . 
i think if His Honour the Speaker puts the question again as to whether leave is granted for Question Period to be extended , he will find agreement in this house . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , if leave is granted , under what conditions will it be granted ? 
is it leave for two more questioners ? 
hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , everyone in the chamber is aware that this will be an extremely long day . 
i will certainly commit this side to two more questions , but without any additional supplementaries to those two questions . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
what generosity ! 
transport 
implementation of Alternative Financing Arrangements Under Federal - Provincial Highways Agreements - Government Position 
hon. Donald H . Oliver : 
honourable senators , the Auditor General says there has been poor implementation of the Minister of Transport ' s directions with regard to the treatment of tolls under federal - provincial highway programs . 
to quote the Auditor General : 
transport Canada should seek clarification of the federal position on the treatment of alternative financing arrangements for its highway investment programs and its application not only to tolls but to such arrangements in general . 
it should assess the need for entrenching that position in all new federal - provincial highway agreements , and take action as appropriate . 
my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate . 
what is this government ' s position on toll highways ? 
is it " toll highways if necessary , but not necessarily toll highways " ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , that is an interesting question . 
the agreement has been interpreted by some provinces to mean that they can have toll highways . 
the matter at the present time is being examined by the Minister of Transport with respect to tolls , in the present and in the future . 
senator Oliver : 
what is the current policy ? 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , the current policy is that the tolls have been allowed in the province of New Brunswick . 
senator Oliver : 
the auditor also had a few more criticisms . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , I am sorry , the understanding was that there would be no supplementary questions . 
it is not for me to rule , but that was the agreement . 
national Finance 
usage of Standard Accounting Principles in Financial Statements of Government - Position of Minister 
hon. Roch Bolduc : 
honourable senators , can the Leader of the Government in the Senate confirm that the Minister of Finance will commit to respecting objective accounting standards in submitting the government ' s financial statements ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I am sure he always does . 
the Minister of Finance is very consistent in his approach . 
senator Bolduc : 
i did not hear your answer . 
what did you say ? 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
i believe the answer was not understood by Senator Bolduc . 
senator Graham : 
the Minister of Finance is always consistent in the approach that he takes with such reports . 
senator Bolduc : 
that is too light an answer for me . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
senator Bolduc - 
senator Bolduc : 
this is a matter of principle . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
senator Bolduc , I must operate under the rules that the Senate gives me . 
the understanding was that there would be two senators with one question each , and no supplementaries . 
i will certainly be prepared to recognize the senators who had questions today , but did not get an opportunity to ask them , next time we meet . 
orders OF THE DAY 
criminal Code Controlled Drugs and Substances Act Corrections and Conditional Release Act 
bill to Amend - Second Reading 
on the Order : 
resuming debate on the motion of the Honourable Senator Moore , seconded by the Honourable Senator Lucier , for the second reading of Bill C - 51 , to amend the Criminal Code , the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act . 
hon. Ron Ghitter : 
honourable senators , I rise today to speak to second reading of this omnibus bill . 
this bill includes some important amendments to three pieces of legislation . 
as is properly the case with omnibus legislation of this nature , there is little in this legislation that is of a controversial nature . 
the amendments have the support of the legal , political and enforcement communities . 
only the Reform Party seems to find the amendments unacceptable in that , in their view , the legislation should have brought forward stricter sanctions in the amended statutes . 
the rationale behind the legislation is appropriate in that , with the scientific advances of this modern era , an individual injured as a result of a crime could live well beyond the year and a day , even though their eventual death could be proven to be attributable to the criminal act . 
it would be interesting to know how many of such cases have resulted in an accused avoiding prosecution . 
i doubt that there are many , but perhaps the committee studying the bill can make such inquiries . 
in any case , the amendment makes sense , and I support it . 
other amendments include the modernization of the fraud and theft provisions in respect of valuable minerals ; the provision of rules governing how the time on a conditional sentence runs following the breach of a condition ; widening the scope of the offence of obtaining the services of a prostitute under 18 years of age , and ensuring that only officials with law enforcement duties can execute search warrants , are also aspects of the bill . 
in the gaming area , there are two interesting amendments , one of which deserves some particular attention . 
this amendment affects only those who are able to utilize these expensive and luxurious cruise ships . 
therefore , I have little concern should their customers be parted from their disposable incomes at the gaming tables on the cruise ships . 
however , I have some concern over the provisions that permit dice games to be conducted in casinos under provincial guidelines . 
i happen to know a little about dice - less elegantly known as " craps " and immortalized in the world ' s largest floating crap game in Guys and Dolls . 
Craps is a fast game . 
money can be won and lost very rapidly and , as I know , mostly lost . 
the game requires an element of skill and knowledge , and most players have neither . 
i do not intend to advance the moral argument on the evils of gambling . 
we just went through this excruciating debate in Alberta last October , when Albertans generally chose to keep VLTs , which followed months of petitions , arguments and soul - searching . 
however , there are certain indisputable truths with respect to this issue . 
governments are just as addicted to gambling as are those who frequent our casinos to play blackjack , or our restaurants and bars to play the VLTs . 
the governments get richer - in Alberta , to the tune of $ 700 to $ 800 million a year from VLTs alone , and over $ 2 billion a year from all forms of gaming . 
while the poor get poorer and their families suffer , ultimately the money received by governments goes from one pocket to the other , in an attempt to assist those who are on social assistance due to their gaming losses . 
i must say that I am basically of the philosophy that individual responsibility must always prevail , and that it is not for the government to guide its policies on the basis of the minority who are unable to show responsibility in their lives . 
once governments get into the area of telling individuals what is best for them , and assuming the responsibilities that should be assumed by the individual , we are in trouble , for where does it stop , and who is to say that the government knows best ? 
i want to assure the house that changes are not intended to increase the level of gambling activity in Canada , nor do we expect them to have this effect . 
with the greatest of respect to the honourable minister , may I suggest that not only will there be an increase in the level of gambling activity in Canada as the result of allowing dice into the casinos , there will be an increase in the losses of those visitors who come into our casinos . 
to suggest otherwise indicates a lack of understanding of the mystical qualities and the lure of " dem bones " and the roll of the dice . 
the expression " roll the dice " you may recall , in a political sense , which certainly caused a furore in some circles in politics in Canada in the past . 
i raise this issue because one could ask where do we stop , if at all ? 
how far should governments go in allowing gambling in our country ? 
a difficult and important moral issue arises , to which the committee charged with examining this bill should direct its attention . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
if no other honourable senator wishes to speak , I will proceed with the motion . 
motion agreed to and bill read second time . 
referred to Committee 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , when shall this bill be read the third time ? 
on motion of Senator Moore , bill referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs . 
corruption of Foreign Public Officials Bill 
second Reading 
honourable senators , I am pleased to rise to speak on a bill of such major importance for the conduct of international business . 
corruption is a threat to the rule of law , democracy and human rights . 
it undermines the principle of good governance , threatens the stability of democratic institutions and undermines the moral foundations of society . 
corruption is prejudicial to international trade and free competition , and hampers economic development , particularly in developing countries . 
through its OECD partners , Canada is working actively to encourage global systems for ensuring security and the improvement of the human condition and to strengthen trading ties , in order to help nations develop and prosper . 
we are increasingly aware that the best way to defend our national interests is to defend them within international institutions and tribunals and to put in place rules and institutions that will allow Canadians to obtain the kind of protection they need . 
bribery of public officials is one of the major problems encountered in international trade and investment . 
within the OECD , it is a very important issue for Canada and for other international organizations . 
the OECD has 29 members , including Canada , the United States , most of the European countries , Japan and South Korea , and is the principal economic policy tribunal for the most advanced industrialized democracies . 
the convention binds each signatory to establish a criminal offence of bribery of foreign public officials in international transactions and to take the necessary action , in accordance with its legal principles , to establish the responsibility of corporations in the event of bribery of a foreign public official . 
each party , or country , must ensure that these penalties are effective , appropriate and dissuasive , and that the bribery and the proceeds of the bribery can be seized . 
the range of penalties must be comparable to that for domestic bribery . 
the new offence of bribery of foreign public officials is a crime carrying a maximum jail sentence of five years . 
section 67.5 of the Income Tax Act has also been amended to add this new offence to the list of Criminal Code offences to which this provision refers , thus ensuring that bribes paid to foreign public officials are not tax deductible . 
the convention also requires the parties to ensure that bribes and the proceeds of bribing a foreign public official can be seized and confiscated , and to consider imposing other civil or administrative penalties . 
the new offence of bribery of foreign public officials is an organized crime offence authorizing the search , seizure and detention of criminal proceeds and is also considered a major offence in a charge of laundering criminal proceeds . 
the convention also contains provisions dealing with enforcement , legal assistance and extradition , which Canada already meets . 
where their judicial system allows it , each party is required to provide assistance with criminal and civil matters . 
during the negotiations , Canada said it could provide assistance to other states in criminal matters but not in civil ones . 
at the G - 8 Summit in Birmingham , Canada and the other G - 8 members undertook to make every effort to ratify the OECD Convention by the end of 1998 . 
the Canadian business community considers the OECD Convention to be one of the greatest achievements to date in the international campaign to combat bribery . 
this convention is regarded as an opportunity to create an environment in which Canadian companies will be able to compete on the basis of quality , price and service , as it will limit the capacity of foreign competitors to use bribery to land contracts . 
so far , Japan and Germany have tabled their instruments of ratification with the secretary general of the OECD . 
also , the United States and the United Kingdom have completed their domestic procedures and should table their instruments in the coming weeks . 
five of the OECD ' s ten largest countries must ratify the Convention by the end of 1998 for it to come into force . 
we hope that Canada , as a leader in the fight against corruption , will be the fifth country to ratify the convention . 
hon. John Lynch - Staunton ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , we on this side have no problems with the bill . 
as a matter of fact , on the Order Paper on November 18 , I put down a question asking if the Canadian government would introduce the appropriate enabling legislation . 
while the question itself has not been answered , I am more than satisfied with the fact that the bill was given first reading this week . 
we understand that the government wishes to fast - track this bill and that the Minister of Foreign Affairs will be here later , as will other witnesses . 
we support that procedure in this case , although I want to emphasize that the fast - tracking of a bill is something we would ordinarily refuse unless it is emergency legislation , such as the settling of labour strife . 
the post office issue was the last bill we dealt with in that way . 
under exceptional circumstances , we certainly support fast - tracking what is identified as emergency legislation . 
this bill , however , does not fall into that category , except that , as Senator Hervieux - Payette has pointed out , if at least five signatories to the convention , representing at least 60 per cent of the trade between 27 OECD members , do not pass the enabling legislation by the end of this year , the convention will suffer a major setback . 
honourable senators , it is too bad the proposed legislation did not come to us earlier so we could have had more time to spend on it . 
perhaps the minister will explain the delay in its introduction in the Senate . 
the point is that this bill is now before us . 
in principle , we believe it will be good legislation . 
we certainly support the convention which has resulted in Bill S - 21 , but we do have some questions for the minister . 
i am delighted that representatives from Transparency International - Canada will be here . 
transparency International is a non - governmental organization , formed only a few years ago , with chapters all over the world . 
this organization has done extraordinary work in the field of international bribery . 
hon. Marcel Prud ' homme : 
honourable senators , I must say that , at the beginning of the week , people were kind enough to inform me of this bill , for which the approval of the Senate is required rather urgently . 
i must say that I share the opinion of Senator Lynch - Staunton . 
the nice thing about the Senate is , I hope , that there are still senators who listen to what others have to say . 
i listened carefully to the comments of Senator Hervieux - Payette and Senator Lynch - Staunton . 
i myself wonder . 
why adopt bills so quickly ? 
i went through this unfortunate experience in the other place , where we sometimes may not have had the wisdom to take the time necessary to look at all the implications of certain bills . 
the signatures of certain countries at the bottom of that new treaty made me suspicious . 
in my 35 years as a parliamentarian , I have travelled to many countries to try to understand what was going on , and I hope to have contributed to Canada ' s good reputation . 
what I did see was , of course , very unpleasant . 
today , when I see countries anxious to sign treaties very quickly , enthusiastically and with honour , to use an old expression , I tell myself that , perhaps , we should be a little more careful about what we are asked to do in a hurry . 
i am pleased to hear that the Minister of Foreign Affairs can come to this chamber . 
this will give us an opportunity to listen to him and to those who absolutely want us to pass this bill quickly . 
what Senator Lynch - Staunton said really caught my attention . 
i have had bad experiences in the House of Commons with fast - track bills . 
i promised myself not to rush into fast - tracking a bill through first , second and third reading . 
i always regretted not saying " no " to the fast - track procedure so that members would have had time to reflect , for at least a day or a weekend , on certain bills . 
honourable senators , this is a very difficult bill to speak against . 
it represents virtue and honesty . 
however , we live on planet Earth . 
those of us with international experience have every reason to be careful before entering into a new treaty . 
having said that , I believe I have put my views as clearly as I can . 
honourable senators , I understand the minister will be appearing in Committee of the Whole this afternoon . 
we will see what he has to say to those senators who have some concern . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , if no other honourable senator wishes to speak , it was moved by Honourable Senator Hervieux - Payette , seconded by Honourable Senator Gill , that this bill be read the second time . 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
bill read second time . 
referred to Committee of the Whole 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , when shall this bill be read the third time ? 
hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I move that the bill be referred to a Committee of the Whole now . 
motion agreed to . 
royal Assent 
notice 
the Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate that the following communication had been received : 
December 3 , 1998 
sir , 
i have the honour to inform you that the Honourable Charles Gonthier , Puisne Judge of the Supreme Court of Canada , in his capacity as Deputy Governor General , will proceed to the Senate Chamber today , the 3 rd day of December , 1998 , at 5:45 p.m. , for the purpose of giving Royal Assent to certain bills . 
the Honourable 
the Speaker of the Senate 
corruption of Foreign Public Officials Bill 
considered in Committee of the Whole 
the Senate was accordingly adjourned during pleasure and put into a Committee of the Whole on the bill , the Honourable Eymard G . Corbin in the Chair . 
the Chairman : 
honourable senators , the Senate is now in Committee of the Whole on Bill S - 21 , respecting the corruption of foreign public officials and the implementation of the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions , and to make related amendments to other acts . 
shall the title be postponed ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
senator Carstairs : 
honourable senators , I would ask that the Honourable Lloyd Axworthy , Minister of Foreign Affairs , be invited to participate in the deliberations of the Committee of the Whole . 
the Chairman : 
is it agreed , honourable senators ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
the Chairman : 
while waiting for the minister to arrive , I would draw to the attention of honourable senators the rules which apply to Committee of the Whole . 
rule 84 deals with such matters as being required to speak from your seats , that there is a 10 - minute time limit but that it is permissible to intervene any number of times , and so on . 
pursuant to rule 21 , of the Rules of the Senate , the Honourable Lloyd Axworthy , P . C . M. P . , Minister of Foreign Affairs , was escorted to a seat in the Senate Chamber . 
senator Carstairs : 
i am pleased to introduce the Honourable Mr. Lloyd Axworthy , Minister of Foreign Affairs . 
he is accompanied by Department of Foreign Affairs officials , Mr. Alan H . Kessel , Director , United Nations Criminal and Treaty Law Division , and Mr. Keith Morrill , Deputy Director , United Nations Criminal and Treaty Law Division . 
the Chairman : 
Mr. Minister , welcome to the Senate . 
do you have a statement at this time ? 
the Honourable Lloyd Axworthy , P . C . , M. P . , Minister of Foreign Affairs : 
honourable senators , thank you for the opportunity to appear before your committee and to address Bill S - 21 dealing with the bribery and corruption of foreign officials in international business transactions . 
this is a very important piece of legislation . 
i appreciate the fact that the Senate is now in deliberation on this matter . 
senator Hervieux - Payette , in presenting this bill , made a very important point . 
she said that corruption distorts all aspects of international trade , competition , economic development and investment . 
in fact , it has a corrosive effect on the fundamentals of the rule of law , democracy and human rights . 
i would compliment the Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs for its recent report on Asia which I had the opportunity to read last evening . 
it makes a very important connection between an effective business climate and an effective global system which has the responsibility to live up to the rule of law and to adhere to basic principles . 
it has certainly been my experience in negotiating and working on a number of these matters that one of the most insidious influences that we now face internationally is the incidence and frequency of corruption in a wide variety of countries . 
it undermines not only what we do as Canadians in our relations , but it has also had quite a dramatic and horrific effect on a number of countries . 
by taking the position represented in this legislation , by setting certain standards and following up with efforts to provide a much stronger international code , we believe countries will , themselves , incorporate a broader set of standards and behaviours which will improve the general business climate internationally . 
we believe this effort will also impact upon the capacity of countries themselves to develop a regime which recognizes that good government , clean and honest government , is the most effective form of promotion for economic development , economic growth , and maintaining good relationships internationally . 
in this sense , we are exporting not only our goods and services but certainly our values . 
we have learned the hard way that integrity and probity in one ' s behaviour result in all kinds of benefits and proper conduct . 
that , in itself , will result in a much better climate of relationships for all of us . 
in developing our partnerships , it is important that we tackle these problems . 
as senators know , this has been a major focus of work in the OECD . 
it has commanded the attention of OECD ministers . 
agreements were made just in 1997 to proceed with this . 
the OECD draft was put together last spring . 
since then , we have worked actively in consultation with the provinces and with the business community in Canada to see how it can be implemented . 
the legislation that is before you today is a result of that . 
i should also like to mention that the Organization of American States has also adopted a convention on corruption which follows many of the same principles , as has the Council of Europe . 
what you can see is a broadening network of commitment and engagement of a number of countries in establishing these kinds of standards . 
this legislation will allow Canada to honour the commitments that we have made at the OECD , as well as commitments made by the Prime Minister at the Denver Summit of the G - 8 and the United Nations . 
i strongly believe that it will also respond to the needs of Canadian business . 
most honourable senators have probably received correspondence or know that the business community , in particular the international business community of Canada , has been a strong advocate of this legislation . 
you will be hearing later from the transparency group who will make the point for you . 
to their credit , they believe that doing clean business is good business . 
they have been a strong promoter of this measure . 
we are in a very key position at this time . 
under the OECD rules , five countries are needed to ratify it in order for it to become law . 
canada is the fifth country to provide the ratification . 
if we can do this expeditiously , we will be able to claim that we are providing the key which will unlock the door to making this happen . 
the essence of the convention is the requirement that each state which is party to it will criminalize the bribery of foreign officials , and take measures to establish the liability of legal persons , which also include corporations , for the bribery of foreign public officials . 
if you look at clause 3 of the bill , you will know that this is the centrepiece of the proposed legislation before you . 
the provision prohibits the bribery of a foreign public official in the course of business . 
it would be punishable on indictment and carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison . 
the bill describes facilitation payments that would be exempt from the ambit of the offence . 
facilitation payments are the normal course of licensing fees and permits which one uses in terms of international trade discourse , for example , cargo fees . 
as well , it would not be an offence if the advantage were lawful in the foreign public official ' s country or public international organization . 
countries have their own laws which we must recognize and by which we must play . 
reasonable expenses incurred in good faith and directly related to the promotion , demonstration or explanation of products and services , or to the execution or performance of a contract , could also be argued as a defence under the act . 
honourable senators have also heard reference to the fact that bribes paid to foreign public officials under this legislation would not be deductible under the Income Tax Act . 
the bill further proposes to create two additional criminal offences , namely , the offence of possession of property or proceeds obtained from bribery of foreign public officials ; and the offence of laundering the property or proceeds . 
in closing , it is useful to quote Donald Johnston , a former minister of justice who is now the Secretary General of the OECD . 
in a recent article he was quoted as having said that integrity in commercial transactions is essential in making the global marketplace work and to assure that the public supports it . 
he said that the logical consequence of globalization is that honesty has to be enforced at the global , not just the national , level . 
with the passage of this legislation , Canada has the opportunity to ratify the OECD convention and to bring it into force , thus ushering in a new era of international accountability . 
Mr. Chairman , I believe that explains the basic intent of the legislation . 
i would be happy to answer any questions that members of the committee may have . 
the Chairman : 
honourable senators , shall clause 1 , the short title , be postponed ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
thank you , minister , for your presentation . 
we certainly support the bill . 
we do have some questions , however , because we have not had much of a chance to study it . 
it is unfortunate that it comes at such a late stage and has to be fast - tracked in order to meet the December 31 deadline . 
if that were not the case , I do not think we would be as cooperative . 
having said that , it is a significant piece of legislation , as well as a rather unusual one . 
three ministers were involved in the press release announcing the bill . 
what minister will be responsible for the application of this bill ? 
under whose jurisdiction does it fall ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
Mr. Chairman , I am cosponsoring this measure with the Minister of Justice . 
clearly , the enforcement provisions are up to the Attorney General of Canada and the attorneys general of the provinces . 
on the enforcement side , it is clearly the Minister of Justice who will be taking the lead . 
as Minister of Foreign Affairs , it is my responsibility to get through legislation which has treaty implications for Canada , which is why I have been taking the lead with regard to the bill . 
under the legislation are certain income tax requirements that will also apply . 
i take on the general wholesaling of the bill while other ministers take on specific responsibilities with respect to it . 
the great joy of being the Minister of Foreign Affairs is that once you get this stuff through you can go on with something else . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
if I were a member of the House of Commons , to whom would I direct questions as to how this bill , once it becomes law , is being applied ? 
who would answer for it ? 
the one thing that is missing in this bill , and I hope you will accept an amendment to include it , is a provision for reporting to Parliament on the monitoring of this bill , so that Parliament will know exactly how it is being applied , if it needs to be applied . 
Mr. Axworthy : 
senator , because I am responsible for reporting to the OECD on the implementation of the convention , I would take on broad reporting responsibility . 
if you were in the House of Commons , senator , or if in fact you were to direct questions to the Leader of the Government in the Senate on this matter , then most of your questions , thankfully , would be referred to the Minister of Justice . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
would you accept an amendment or addition to the bill to include a requirement that there be a report tabled in Parliament on a regular basis ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
Yes. 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
if we were to write one today , would you accept it ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
Yes. 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
thank you , minister . 
my other questions are just for clarification . 
are subsidiaries and parent companies covered under clause 3 ( 1 ) of the bill ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
i think it would depend on whether the subsidiary was doing business in Canada . 
it is much more difficult to use the bill extra - territorially to indict a subsidiary of a Canadian company that has its incorporation in some other country . 
if there is any form of legal attachment in terms of responsibilities of the head office of that subsidiary , then the legislation would apply . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
the definition of business in the bill states that it is limited to any kind of business carried out in Canada or elsewhere for profit . 
why would non - profit businesses not also be included ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
in this case , the purpose behind the OECD discussions was to deal specifically with business transactions in this area . 
as a result , we are following the code set out by the OECD . 
i can find the reference on that . 
in fact , the convention itself reads " on combating bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions . " 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
there is nothing to stop a company from setting up a charitable foundation and funnelling bribes through that foundation , which is legally set up on a non - profit basis , is that correct ? 
there is nothing to stop anyone from finding loopholes in this law , but if you included the word " non - profit " that would put such corporations on alert , too . 
Mr. Axworthy : 
i am not a lawyer . 
as a result , I pray a lot . 
if some business was attempting to engage in a conspiracy to defraud by way of front companies or other kinds of surrogate organizations , the skill of the RCMP and our justice officials would hunt them down . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
that was spoken like a true minister of justice . 
i will draft an amendment and let my colleagues proceed with their questions . 
senator Atkins : 
i am curious as to whether a bid for the IOC - that is , the International Olympic Committee - although it is not under the definition of " business , " would apply to this law . 
Mr. Axworthy : 
i always thought that involved sport , not business . 
in today ' s world , who knows . 
that is my answer . 
i am sorry , senator . 
i do not think it would apply in this case . 
senator Tkachuk : 
i have a question that is directly related to Senator Lynch - Staunton ' s question . 
i am not sure whether it was accepted that there would be an amendment on the question of non - profit status . 
Mr. Axworthy : 
no , it would be on reporting . 
senator Atkins : 
i am not a lawyer either , minister , so I have the same problem . 
for example , the Olympic corporation is probably a non - profit organization , and many sports organizations are run as non - profit organizations . 
in other words , as a non - profit organization you can carry on business anywhere you want like any other corporation . 
internationally , I am sure there are many non - profit organizations that are doing business , including some that are charitable and some that are not . 
will those be covered ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
perhaps I can go back to the bill itself . 
in the definition , article 2 states that " business means any business , profession , trade , calling , manufacture or undertaking of any kind carried on in Canada or elsewhere for profit . " 
that is the definition contained in the bill and that fits the OECD convention , which was to deal with business transactions . 
i have no doubt there may be other transgressions of the kind you describe . 
they are presently not addressed in this bill . 
the main concern for us was to deal with the growing incidence of corruption and how it impeded business . 
from the discussions we have had with the business community in Canada , it was their concern as well that we tackle that specific problem in this legislation . 
that is why questions about non - profit organizations were not included . 
there would only be an attachment if there were an attempt to use a non - profit organization as a front or to commit conspiracy against the act . 
it would then be part of the investigation that the police and justice officials would undertake . 
senator Tkachuk : 
Mr. Axworthy : 
in clause 2 , it is carried on in Canada for profit . 
that is the definition contained in the legislation . 
senator Tkachuk : 
it does not matter what the vehicle is , then ? 
that is to say , it could be a person or a non - profit organization ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
if they are in the business of making a profit , they would be covered . 
senator Austin : 
minister , for whatever value my opinion has , I think you gave the right answer , namely , that you look at the facts to see whether the transaction is in the nature of a for - profit transaction . 
i am a lawyer , but my advice is free . 
Mr. Axworthy : 
that is a first ! 
senator Austin : 
with regard to questions looking for exclusionary practices , two questions have been asked already , namely , the question of " non - profit " and the question of " subsidiary . " 
the third question is whether the person alleged to have committed an offence would not have committed that offence if the transaction were with a member of a political party . 
in the original material issued by the OECD and commentaries related to those documents , it was intended in the agreement to exclude transactions with " political officials , " meaning members of a political party , not in the legislative , administrative or judicial roles . 
if the answer to that question is that they are excluded , would it not be easy for those countries who wished to turn their back on this type of legislation to appoint recipients as party officials ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
i refer you to the definition found inclause 2 of the bill , where it says " a person who holds a legislative , administrative or judicial position of a foreign state , " meaning a " member of Parliament , including the upper chamber , an official within government or a judge . " 
that is the definition that we have . 
if one were to use it as a party position - and , there are some countries in which the party sometimes holds precedence over officials positions - that would have to be tested in the law itself . 
the intent is there , but I would rely , again , upon the reading of the law in terms of the attorneys general to determine whether there was an effort to get around the law . 
we would then be able to see it by whatever precedent applies . 
Mr. Kessel has provided more elaboration . 
it also includes any definition of " foreign public official . " 
it says , " any person exercising a public function for a foreign country . " 
if someone was " Secretary General of the Vegetarian Party , " and that party was in government at the time , but exercising a public function , they would be caught under the act . 
that is contained in the clause of the convention of the OECD . 
senator Austin : 
could we have a definition of " person " ? 
there is a reference in the definition clause , clause 2 , to section 2 of the Criminal Code . 
earlier , I asked for a copy of the Criminal Code , which has just arrived as we speak . 
we are talking about juridical persons as well as living persons . 
Mr. Axworthy : 
Yes. 
senator Austin : 
in asking these questions , I recognize how important this advance is in terms of international commercial practice and how imperfect international negotiations can be . 
however , what was agreed to in November of 1997 is certainly an advance , and I welcome the legislation . 
senator Kinsella : 
minister , you mentioned in your presentation that there had been discussion with the provinces . 
could you elaborate on that , and how it relates to the ratification process of the convention ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
we thought it was important to consult with the provinces , but this legislation is federal legislation . 
we worked with them on the basis that the provincial attorneys general would also be part of the enforcement agency under the bill . 
the bill is a stand - alone bill , but provincial attorneys general would also be agents of the law in this case . 
senator Kinsella : 
article 8 of the convention deals with the matter of accounting . 
section 1 , in part , says : 
... each Party shall take measures as may be necessary , within the framework of its laws and regulations regarding the maintenance of books and records , financial statement disclosures , and accounting and auditing standards ... 
those seem to be items that fall under provincial jurisdiction . 
whilst the provincial attorneys general might have given an indication of agreement to the Criminal Code kind of amendments , there seems to be an obligation for accounting practices to be assumed under provincial jurisdiction . 
therefore , are you telling us that it is not necessary to have more formal concurrence from the provinces for the ratification of this convention ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
in fact , the federal Criminal Code already includes a number of offences which work on the generally accepted accounting principles . 
section 397 , 361 , 362 , 400 , 366 , 388 , all require measures similar to those contained in this proposed legislation . 
therefore , it is already part of the federal legal regime . 
senator Kinsella : 
notwithstanding that , have there been discussions with the provinces ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
Yes. 
senator Kinsella : 
was the result of that discussion that the provinces are in agreement that this is a good move ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
Yes. 
senator Kinsella : 
we also see this as an important instrument in the area of human rights and international business . 
let me turn to a couple of specific items . 
in the convention , in Article 1 , section 4 , they define " foreign public official . " 
Mr. Axworthy : 
i have just been informed that the reason for that is we are using the definition which is contained in the Criminal Code in order to be consistent . 
senator Kinsella : 
was there an analysis that this does not make a difference , orif it made a difference , what was that difference ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
the case law in Canada said that " elected " covers all kind of positions including those appointed . 
we are all held under scrutiny . 
senator Kinsella : 
would the definition in clause 2 cover the situation of a bribe being given to someone in contemplation of that person becoming an official ? 
in other words , the bribe being made before the person becomes an official ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
you are questioning me on a point of law . 
my response would be that if it were proven that that person then became a public official under the definition of the bill , than an offence under the bill could have been committed . 
therefore , if one were hoping that the person would become the minister of the ministry responsible for customs and the person ended up being the minister of foreign affairs , one might have made a bad investment . 
senator Andreychuk : 
minister , the OECD had unwritten rules some time ago . 
am I correct that this legislation will only cover bribes directly or indirectly to the official , and that he or she must gain from it ? 
from my small venture into that unique and unusual world of international diplomacy , my concern is that the money is rarely paid these days directly to the official , nor does he gain from it . 
however , surprise , surprise , someone very near and dear to him is profiting from it . 
there is no direct conversion , there is no direct implication of the public official . 
one must simply go to that country , live there for a while , and what was often said was " You learn the culture . " 
in other words , you knew where to place the money . 
am I correct in my quick reading of this proposed legislation that none of that activity will be stopped by this legislation ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
actually , senator , the bill does cover any offence that would be a bribe directly or indirectly , which would include agents of a person and family members . 
it would cover off the concern you raise . 
senator Andreychuk : 
are you saying that if a public official does not get involved in any way , nor are there any conversations , but if some gift is given to a close friend of the minister ' s or to his extended family , with no discussion as to why that gift is given , then we would be in a position to take action ? 
in other words , are you saying that it is inference we are working from , not direct evidence ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
senator , there would have to be some evidentiary process . 
you would have to prove that the public official gained some benefit along the way through this activity . 
that brings us back to investigation . 
again , the wording is taken from the Criminal Code , so that the case law under that statute would be applicable . 
senator Andreychuk : 
i am pleased to see that the legislation is now dealing with those who are giving bribes . 
we have often pointed and accused people for accepting them but we have rarely commented on the fact that it was more from the developed world that the bribes were coming . 
we are going in the right direction . 
i want to underscore that there is a growing sophistication on how to move money and gain benefits . 
i am not sure that this proposed legislation will trap it . 
do we feel that we have sufficient mechanisms in place to be able to prosecute fully ? 
much of the evidence will be offshore , and probably offshore from the country where the official is located , or the third party , in perhaps a third country . 
do we have enabling legislation sufficient to address that situation today ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
one of the corollary developments of the convention has been quite active arrangements being made for coordination of police activities and the sharing of information . 
clearly , even under the convention , there is a requirement for mutual assistance in these matters . 
signatories would then be in a position where , if a case is considered on either side of the exchange , the other country would be required to cooperate actively with police forces in that investigation . 
senator Andreychuk : 
will this legislation trap officials in the World Bank and other institutions like that who control much of the foreign activity ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
yes , it does include members of the international organizations . 
senator Andreychuk : 
finally , will you be considering different instructions to foreign service officers ? 
presently , when business goes out , the instruction to our foreign service is that they are not to get involved in the contents and the negotiations of contracts . 
however , they do hear a lot and know a lot . 
will they have increased responsibilities and obligations to bring forward information for investigation , and has that been put in any kind of policy guideline that we can see ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
if there is any sense that a crime has been committed , any Canadian public official is under an obligation to report it . 
we will also be ensuring , through the cooperation of many of the international business groups involved in the consultation in this , that people doing business overseas will know what their obligations will be under the act . 
senator Andreychuk : 
will there be a separate set of guidelines ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
i am not sure it is necessary . 
when we set out instructions to each head of mission , one of the requirements was that they follow through on the laws of Canada . 
senator Joyal : 
i would like to continue on the last question of Senator Andreychuk about the information to give or make available to Canadian businesses regarding their activities abroad . 
i remember a few years ago that the Auditor General of Canada had noted in his report irregular payments made by certain Crown agencies , which I will not name . 
these agencies , in their activities abroad , had remitted payments which , according to the Auditor General , did not comply with Canadian practice . 
i think that if we are going to encourage the private sector to comply with the objectives of the law - and I will repeat an adage that my colleague Senator Beaudoin knows well - " the wife of Caesar must be above all suspicion . " 
and I think the first to serve as an example of this are Canadian government agencies involved in trading activities abroad . 
do you not consider it appropriate to inform Canadian agencies involved in trading activities of the objectives of this law so that no one may later plead ignorance of the initiative we are pursuing today ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
senator , no doubt there will be communication . 
currently , we have quite a good Web site connecting all our posts abroad , our officials , and all those in the posts who represent different agencies , Crown corporations , and others who work abroad . 
once proposed legislation of this kind receives Royal Assent , its purpose would certainly be posted on that Web site , and we would undertake any other form of dissemination that is required . 
this will be an important piece of legislation . 
it will set a new standard , and we want to ensure that people recognize that it will be setting a new international standard for business transactions . 
senator Joyal : 
in the same context , Senator Lynch - Staunton mentioned the Senate being given an opportunity to follow up on how the act is being implemented . 
we have had , in the last month , legislation sponsored by our colleague Senator Corbin . 
the Senate had the opportunity to debate and report on it . 
bill C - 3 is before the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs , and that is a bill which contains similar provisions . 
we would invite you to consider an initiative that would give the Senate the opportunity to review the implementation of this legislation , especially considering that we are breaking ground on this . 
we are not just one of the 29 countries signing it ; we are the fifth . 
it is important that members of this house have an opportunity to follow the implementation of this legislation . 
i would certainly support such an initiative . 
it would , as you have said , echo the objective of the report that the Honourable Senator Stewart tabled yesterday in this house in order to ensure that all our initiatives on the international front are coordinated and measured by the same standards of ethics . 
Mr. Axworthy : 
on that point , Senator Joyal , I have talked to officials , as has Minister Marchi . 
we would like to respond to that report . 
i consider it to be a very instrumental report . 
when we are able to fully review it , we will report back to the chair of the committee and to the committee itself our views and the initiatives that it recommends . 
we will be responding to that report . 
there are two levels of reporting . 
one is by the OECD itself , and that is part of the convention . 
it would be done under its own assessment and monitoring procedures . 
senator Joyal : 
i should like to return to the question of non - profit corporations that was raised by other colleagues . 
the Criminal Code states that " person " is also defined in section 33 of the Interpretation Act , and that it includes a corporation . 
it was held in R . v. Township of Richmond that " corporation " includes a municipal corporation which could therefore be charged with an offence contrary to the Fisheries Act and so forth . 
a corporation , as we say in French , is a - 
we are talking about a corporation . 
whether this is a profit - making or non - profit corporation , it exists and it is justiciable . 
accordingly , I do not see how there can be support for a narrow definition of the word " person " that excludes non - profit corporations . 
do have you an opinion indicating anything to the contrary ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
perhaps to provide further clarification on that point , I might refer to , as you did , " person " as defined in section 2 of the Criminal Code . 
it reads as follows : 
" every one , " " person , " " owner , " and similar expressions include Her Majesty and public bodies , bodies corporate , societies , companies and inhabitants of counties , parishes , municipalities or other districts in relation to the acts and things that they are capable of doing and owning respectively ; 
the key in this case is that if any of those named above is engaged in a profit exercise , it would come under the convention . 
senator Joyal : 
i plead for a liberal interpretation of this section , if you understand me , Mr. Minister . 
Mr. Axworthy : 
i am always in favour of liberal interpretations . 
senator Joyal : 
i should like to move on to subclause 3 ( 3 ) which reads , in part , as follows : 
( a ) is permitted or required under the laws of the foreign state ... 
i am having some second thoughts about that proposed provision because it seems to me that we may be creating a double standard . 
i am not sure if , with such open - ended drafting , or loophole , we are not in fact supporting , indirectly - I do not mean at all that it is the objective of the bill - what we want to prohibit in countries where the laws are not as compelling as our own legislation . 
it seems to me that we should follow the code of ethics we have in Canada when we are dealing with other countries . 
i do not want to give any analogies , because they may not apply perfectly , but there is no doubt that certain acts that are prohibited in our Criminal Code could be allowed in other countries . 
are we creating a loophole ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
the exact definitions and interpretations are clearly subject to the national laws of those countries . 
the convention itself is a negotiated one . 
it is one that brings countries together to find what is a common norm which we can accept . 
however , let us take this for what it is . 
it is a major step , based upon an agreement of other countries , to establish this as a norm . 
it will take some while to see how it works . 
there are reporting or monitoring mechanisms to determine that . 
one reason we want a stand - alone act is so that we can adapt it over time without having to make repeated Criminal Code amendments . 
therefore , we will learn from it . 
if we were now to say that we will take the quintessential performances that we expect at the highest level in Canada and assume they will happen in some other country automatically , I think we would be , as I say , putting ourselves in some jeopardy , first , by applying our own standards to an international treaty , and second , by putting our own business community at a disadvantage as a result . 
senator Joyal : 
clause 6 of the bill reads as follows : 
a peace officer or a person acting under the direction of a peace officer is not guilty of an offence under section 4 or 5 if the peace officer or person does any thing mentioned in either of those sections for the purposes of an investigation or otherwise in the execution of the peace officer ' s duties . 
my first reaction to that was to recall the McDonald commission . 
are we not giving peace officers our blessing to break the law when they are conducting investigations ? 
were there not some commissions that made very stringent recommendations to Parliament regarding how peace officers must abide by the legislation when they conduct their investigations ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
senator , this is designed primarily to protect police officers doing investigations . 
if they seize proceeds from an illegal act , an act of bribery , they have to be given exemption , otherwise they would be liable under the act . 
we would have great difficulty with enforcement if we started indicting police officers for carrying out their duty of dealing with whatever exchange had taken place under a bribery charge . 
this is simply to ensure there is a clear sense of accountability for those who are engaged in the act . 
it does not drag police officers themselves into criminal conduct . 
senator Stewart : 
we all know that Canada is highly dependent on trade in goods and services . 
presumably , one of the chief purposes of bribery , as dealt with in this bill , would be the facilitation of the business activities of the persons mentioned in the definition . 
that leads me to two related questions , both anticipated , to some extent , by Senator Joyal . 
are we convinced of the capacity of the governments who have signed the convention to perform ? 
standard of performance by our Canadian business persons and then finding that that high standard is not being lived up to by business persons of other countries , all to our disadvantage in terms of trade in goods and services . 
i suspect that it will require almost the rhetorical ability of the Governor of the Bank of Canada to deal with my first question . 
are you satisfied that the signatories are able to deliver on the terms of the convention ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
first , Senator Stewart , we always have to work on a basic belief that a government that commits itself to ratify a treaty is prepared to implement its standards . 
no one is perfect , as we all know . 
in the human rights field , we know countries are far from perfect . 
nevertheless , states are ratifying on the basis of commitments . 
in this particular case , we are dealing with 14 states in the OECD , all of which are well - developed , active countries with good governance and very strong laws . 
will it be perfect ? 
we do not know , but , as I said earlier , we will monitor it , and correct it , but it is important to take the first step . 
my own experience with other treaties has been that they also set standards for countries other than the signatory countries themselves . 
can I guarantee absolute adherence ? 
no , but I can certainly guarantee the situation will be much better than it is now . 
senator Stewart : 
i thank you for that response . 
i have a very easy question now . 
you say there are 14 countries which are signatories . 
Mr. Axworthy : 
it is actually 29 . 
i misspoke . 
senator Stewart : 
which four of that 29 have already put themselves , in terms of ratification and legislation , in a position to perform ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
right now it would be the United States , the U . K . , Japan and Germany . 
we would be the fifth . 
senator Prud ' homme : 
this bill originated in the Senate , which is a rare occurrence . 
this is an excellent precedent . 
the fact that we are presently sitting in Committee of the Whole tells me that you want the bill passed as quickly as possible . 
i would have expected this bill to be referred instead to the Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs chaired by Senator Milne . 
when I look at the list of the countries that were the first to sign this treaty , my suspicions only get stronger . 
i am a little concerned about their haste to sign it . 
looking at who has yet to sign , I ask myself why Canada should be the fifth signatory . 
do you have any assurances that a Senate bill can be passed quickly by the other place ? 
have discussions taken place with the various political parties , seeing that we are expected to pass this bill today ? 
we all know how virulent the Reform Party is and what state of mind the Bloc Qu é b é cois is in these days : slightly depressed following their defeat in the Quebec election last Monday . 
why not refer it to the Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
first , Senator Prud ' homme , let me it make clear that I make no distinction between the two chambers in terms of introducing bills of this importance . 
senator Prud ' homme : 
we are very happy . 
Mr. Axworthy : 
in fact , I wish to express my appreciation to the Senate for the way in which they dealt with the pre - clearance transit bill , which is now going into second reading and receiving the proper consideration . 
we have a number of initiatives in international agreements and conventions that are coming and I hope we can continue to work closely with this chamber in introducing them and getting your cooperation . 
as to this specific legislation , I cannot answer as to which committee it will be referred to , that is up to leadership of the Senate . 
you run your own business . 
however , as far as the House of Commons is concerned we are at present in negotiation with the various parties to determine if we can get consideration . 
it depends in part on when it emerges from the Senate . 
if we can have the bill so that the Commons can consider it next week then I believe we will have it by the adjournment , but that is all subject to negotiation . 
senator Prud ' homme : 
if Canada is the fifth country to sign , you will be very happy , but what should we expect from countries that do not sign ? 
must they respect the treaty ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
the 29 countries have all signed and now it is a matter of ratification . 
the important point about the fifth country is that it establishes the convention . 
as I indicated , the United States , United Kingdom , Germany and Japan , which are , if not the most significant economic powers in the world , certainly our major trading partners and competitors , have already signed on and that is the lead we want to deal with . 
i am sure the others will come along . 
as we have found in other treaties , if everyone waits for everyone else you never get anywhere and that is one reason we are asking for the Senate ' s approval before the end of the year . 
one reason that it is coming in at this time is that we wanted to allow for careful consideration by the business community in Canada , which we did undertake , and they have made several recommendations on the legislation , as well as the provinces . 
in the realm of international treaty making , this is a very quick response , which I believe indicates the wide degree of support it has right now . 
senator Prud ' homme : 
over the years , and I think some of my colleagues have touched on this subject , we have seen great corruption coming from some Crown corporations . 
if someone were to challenge me , I will give them the amount of money , what it was for and who got the money . 
what assurance do we have that this bill covers people who are not officials and who are used as intermediaries at great cost because they happen to know the right person in the right place ? 
i am thinking of an incident where $ 15 million was paid for the sale of a CANDU reactor in a certain country . 
we know who got the money . 
will that be covered by this bill ? 
i have many examples , but they will disturb the Christmas atmosphere . 
Mr. Axworthy : 
i have not noticed much Christmas atmosphere from the place I occupy every day but I am glad it is happening here . 
two points have already been raised ; one being that under the definition the convention does cover Crown corporations . 
we are talking about including Her Majesty and public bodies , corporate societies , companies , inhabitants , et cetera , so they would all be covered if there was a profit transaction . 
second , in response to Senator Andreychuk , I pointed out that convention also covered indirect activities , which would include agents , family and other persons who would be used in some way to act as intermediaries . 
you must prove it and you must get the police evidence ; nevertheless , I believe they are covered under this act . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
i have one question , and then I will read what I hope will be an acceptable amendment , subject to the legal experts refining the language if need be . 
you mentioned earlier in your presentation that the OAS also had a similar convention that we have yet to sign . 
would this bill cover the OAS requirements ; in other words , any other international organization which decides to try and implement the same sort of limitations on bribery ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
senator , I believe that this bill will cover the OAS convention . 
there may be some tinkering on the edges , but they have very strong parallel convention articles in them . 
the legislative changes we are making under this bill would allow us to proceed with our obligations under the OAS as well . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
honourable senators , my suggested amendment is as follows : 
the minister of - fill in the blank , but I imagine it will be the Minister of Justice - within four months of the end of the previous fiscal year shall table in both Houses of Parliament an annual report on all matters concerned with the enforcement of this act . 
Mr. Axworthy : 
senator , I just asked the officials for a view on that interpretation . 
it would depend , in part , on what you are looking for . 
if you are looking for enforcement actions in Canada , it would be the Minister of Justice . 
if you are looking for reports on what is happening with other countries under the conventions , it would be the Minister of Foreign Affairs . 
what I recommend is that it say that the Government of Canada would table a report , as opposed to a specific minister . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
we are looking for a regular report on an annual basis as to how the act is being enforced , who has been caught under it and whether it is effective . 
i now have what the law officers have suggested , and I will read it again . 
annual Report 
12 . Within four months of the end of each fiscal year , the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada shall prepare a report on the administration of this act , and the minister shall cause a copy of the report to be laid before each house of Parliament on any of the first 15 days on which that house is sitting after the report is completed ; and 
( b ) by renumbering the clauses ... 
it is a question of who is responsible for tabling the report . 
Mr. Axworthy : 
i would expect there to be a large catalogue of prosecutions every year . 
in the United States , where they have had similar legislation since 1997 , there have been about 16 . 
in effect , it would be a short report . 
going back to what Senator Joyal said , if you wanted to broaden that orbit slightly to include examination of what we found under the convention in the OECD itself , that would be the responsibility of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade . 
it is a shared responsibility in this case . 
my point is that with respect to requiring the Minister of Justice , all you would get are prosecutions in Canada . 
you would not get the broader assessment that might be made in terms of OECD activity . 
if I hear the intent of senators , you would like to have that broader assessment . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
correct . 
could we put in something to the effect " the Minister of Foreign Affairs , the Minister of Justice and the Minister for International Trade shall jointly ... " ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
sure . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
something like that . 
Mr. Axworthy : 
Yes. 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
perhaps you should refine it , and then we can bring it up at third reading when we get there . 
Mr. Axworthy : 
we will consult with the law officers of the chamber and come up with some words for you by third reading . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
could you do that before we adjourn today ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
Yes. 
my distinguished colleagues can stay a few minutes after I am through and do their refining legal work . 
senator Kinsella : 
looking with great specificity at the matter of the ratification of this convention , perhaps it would be good for us to have on our record the process followed by Canada in depositing the instrument of ratification . 
am I correct in understanding that you , as Minister of Foreign Affairs , will make a recommendation to the Privy Council that a decision will be taken and a minute recorded ? 
that will constitute the authorization for you , as Minister of Foreign Affairs , to deposit that instrument of ratification with the depository . 
Mr. Axworthy : 
there would have to be an Order in Council authorizing me to proceed with the ratification . 
senator Kinsella : 
that is done pursuant to article 14 of the convention . 
in my reading of this convention , that could be done this afternoon , even though this particular bill has not passed Parliament . 
indeed , if they are a little slow in the other place , I suggest that you consider doing that and depositing that instrument of ratification on December 10 , which is International Human Rights Day . 
in other words , it is the future tense . 
we are obviously well along the way . 
indeed , as you can see , honourable senators are anxious to see this bill enacted . 
we could ratify that convention without this bill having passed Parliament . 
am I incorrect in my reading of the convention , or am I correct ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
i think you are correct in terms of form . 
senator Kinsella : 
i think my technical questions have been raised and answered by other senators . 
that is all I have . 
senator Eyton : 
Mr. Minister , for the record I wish to say that this convention as conveyed in the bill before us is well supported by business both in Canada and worldwide . 
it is not perfect , and that is because it is the result of discussion , compromise and consensus amongst thousands of individuals and organizations . 
however , it is a great step forward . 
when the OECD became seized of the subject and was proposing this action , the ICC struck a committee or commission with specialists who became much engaged in the discussions I mentioned earlier . 
the product has the blessing of the ICC . 
that is not immaterial . 
the ICC has membership representing over 120 countries . 
the national organization of the ICC is the Canadian Council for International Business . 
taken together , all of this means that the convention and the bill are strongly supported by world business , represented by the ICC , here in Canada by the Canadian Council for International Business , and its related organization , the Canadian Chamber of Commerce . 
as well , I should like to add my support for the bill . 
i am rather curious as to what the Canadian government may do , what you may do in your efforts and your colleagues may do beyond the OECD . 
Mr. Axworthy : 
senator Eyton , I appreciate your overview of the active work that has been done through the international business organization . 
one essential part of this process is to ensure that there is a concurrence of views . 
this convention is a product of that work . 
in terms of other activities , as I pointed out during my opening remarks , we are also active in the OAS on pursuing a convention there . 
this legislation will conform to that . 
the Council of Europe is pursuing activities . 
various protocols are being examined . 
part of the discussion will address how corruption is dealt with under those auspices . 
ultimately , the WTO will be looking at this as part of its procedures as well . 
this convention is a building block . 
such a statement by the 29 OECD countries carries a lot of significance and weight and will provide the launching pad for a much broader application of these standards . 
senator Grafstein : 
Mr. Minister , I want to follow up on the question to which Senator Stewart and Senator Eyton have alluded . 
in the next few years - I am not sure of the actual timing - some major economies will be actively pursuing accession to the WTO . 
is there a common view or is it the view of the Government of Canada that , as a precursor to membership - I do not want to lay it down as a pre - condition - this treaty should be ratified , particularly by the major players where Canada has a major interest in pursuing its trade and investment proposals ? 
i am thinking particularly , without any criticism at all , of China . 
we know China is actively engaged in seeking to join the WTO . 
Mr. Axworthy : 
in evaluating and judging applications , that is one of the tests which is increasingly being applied in terms of accession . 
countries that are interested in becoming involved recognize that they will have to begin changing standards . 
in some cases , that is a very significant challenge , but it is one that is faced by other countries . 
to get back to the point I raised with Senator Eyton , by establishing a benchmark of 29 OECD countries - countries recognized to be among the most developed and active international traders - this convention provides a very strong signal . 
furthermore , we hope this convention will eventually become more universal . 
meanwhile , as you know from your own experience , a country need not be a signatory to a treaty to adhere to its standards . 
however , a country operating outside of those standards will become increasingly stigmatized . 
that is one of the results of getting this convention on the law books . 
senator Joyal : 
what initiative are you contemplating to ensure that a greater number of countries join the ratification process , especially the major trading countries ? 
all of us with international experience know that a certain number of countries in the world will play a key role as international models to ensure that the objectives of this convention will be implemented . 
to be more specific , what is your game plan to ensure that we are not limited to five countries and that , in the reasonable future , Canada ' s major trading partners will join the convention ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
the four countries which have already ratified and Canada together represent probably the top export countries in the world . 
it is not just a matter of numbers . 
it is also a matter of weight that they bring to bear on the matter . 
as to the initiations , this was launched just in May of last year at the OECD ministerial meetings . 
as I said earlier , we are fast - tracking this convention , among a number of countries , until the year 2000 . 
it is registered at the G - 8 for the forthcoming meetings in June 1999 . 
for us to carry some leverage , we must pass it . 
it is difficult for us to urge on others if we are still in active debate . 
we want to have this matter completed so that when we attend a number of these active international meetings in the new year , we will carry in Canada ' s endorsement . 
senator Joyal : 
i understand that the four countries which have already signed are the U.S. , Germany , Japan and the United Kingdom . 
would you agree to keep the ratification of that convention as the top agenda item in your bilateral discussions with the other trading partners when you travel around the world or when the Canadian government is heading Team Canada missions ? 
Mr. Axworthy : 
yes , this is one of the items considered to be of high priority by the Prime Minister , Minister Marchi and myself . 
we will certainly be using every opportunity to encourage other countries to sign on as quickly as they can once we have ratification . 
senator Joyal : 
if that ratification happens to be completed before the adjournment date of the other place , and in time for the visit of the French Prime Minister in mid - December , can we rely on to you raise that issue with the French Prime Minister ? 
senator Prud ' homme : 
i just wanted to make sure that the reason for my hesitation was clear , Mr. Minister . 
i am not against the bill , on the contrary . 
i was the one who suggested it to the Parliamentary Centre . 
i am a member of the board of the Parliamentary Centre which held a seminar on corruption and corrupt people . 
basically , everyone at that seminar share the same views . 
i might just mention that Mr. Stanfield is a member of the board , as is Mr. Sharp . 
it is a very prominent board . 
i suggested that , if we hold a seminar to discuss corrupt people , perhaps we should hold one to discuss the corrupter . 
it is all very fine and well to talk about corrupted people , but we should also talk about those who do the corrupting . 
in many countries , there would be no corrupted people without very sophisticated people to corrupt them . 
i want to make it very clear that I am not opposed to passing the bill , but I am being very cautious in these matters . 
the Chairman : 
honourable senators , that completes my list . 
if the minister wishes to make a final statement , I invite him to do so at this time . 
Mr. Axworthy : 
Mr. Chairman , I would like to thank the senators for their consideration of this bill . 
i appreciate the proposed amendment . 
i think it will strengthen the legislation . 
i look forward to passage of the bill so that I can get on to making similar interventions with my colleagues in the other place . 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , on behalf of all of you , I wish to thank Minister Axworthy for his presence here and for the very clear and concise manner in which he has responded to all our questions and concerns . 
this is a very important piece of legislation . 
as the minister mentioned , other legislation with international ramifications is presently before the Senate . 
senator Carstairs : 
honourable senators , there is another group of witnesses from Transparency International . 
is it the wish of honourable senators to hear from them this afternoon ? 
the Chairman : 
is it agreed , honourable senators ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
senator Carstairs : 
honourable senators , from Transparency International Canada , we have Mr. Wesley Cragg , who is the Chairman and the President . 
with him is Mr. Michael Davies , who is the Vice - President , General Counsel and Secretary . 
i should say that in their other lives Mr. Davies is the Vice - President , General Counsel and Secretary of General Electric Canada ; and Mr. Cragg is with the School of Business at York University . 
the Chairman : 
welcome to the committee , gentlemen . 
i invite either or both of you to make a statement , after which we will proceed with questions . 
Mr. Wesley Cragg , President , Transparency International Canada : 
Mr. Chairman , I am very pleased to be here . 
this is a very important occasion for Canada and for the international community . 
i will make a few comments and Michael Davies will follow with one or two of his own . 
we will then be happy to respond to your questions . 
transparency International supports very strongly this legislation . 
for some time , we have been urging the government to table anti - corruption legislation before the end of the current year . 
Mr. Axworthy has already indicated that the convention which Canada signed last December sets conditions that must be met if the convention is to come into effect . 
if Canada does not ratify the convention by the end of December , those conditions simply will not be met . 
we are in the rather remarkable position of being number five , which is in some respects the most important position . 
thus , in my view , this will bring considerable honour to this chamber and to the Parliament of Canada , as well as to Canada . 
if it is not passed , in our view , Canada will have lost an important opportunity to provide leadership in an area in which it is widely respected . 
that is one of our central concerns . 
i want to talk a bit about corruption and why Transparency International is concerned about it . 
it is important to begin with a little history , which does not have to be lengthy . 
it is worth noting that corruption has only recently appeared as an issue on the public agenda . 
it is worth tracking a little bit why that is the case . 
as recently as a few years ago , corruption simply was not a word that was used in polite company , certainly not in public . 
no one was doing it in international fora or in national fora . 
the basic position of the World Bank and similar institutions , like the International Monetary Fund , was that corruption was essentially a cultural problem or political problem . 
it was usually considered to be a problem for Third World countries , and ones that they would have to deal with . 
the accompanying view was that corruption did not cause any economic difficulties , certainly not for the industrialized world . 
it was felt that if it had any effect at all it operated as a kind of grease to move economic machinery along when there were bureaucratic obstacles in its way . 
transparency International was formed five years ago in large measure to change that perception . 
those attitudes , in our view , and in the view of the people who founded Transparency International , were extremely damaging and very inaccurate . 
the position of Transparency International is stated quite succinctly by the first president and chairman of the Transparency International Advisory Council , General Obasanjo , which is a name which some of you , perhaps , will recognize . 
he was quoted in the Financial Times in October of 1994 as saying , " Let us strip away excuses and explanations . 
in no society , north , south or east , is it acceptable to the people for their leaders to feather their own nests at public expense . 
once this simple truth is widely accepted , more meaningful social and economic development will follow . " 
general Obasanjo , as you will remember , was subsequently escorted to jail in Nigeria where he spent a good period of time . 
canada played a significant role in the Commonwealth advocating for serious change in Nigeria , as well as in his release much more recently . 
he continues to be active in Transparency International as the chairman of our advisory committee and stands to us as a symbol of Third World views on the subject of corruption . 
it is significant that the issue of corruption and its treatment in the industrialized world is being watched very closely in the developing world . 
i can tell you that there are people around the world who are extremely interested in what this chamber will do today and what the House of Commons will do , we hope , next week . 
transparency International is concerned about corruption . 
it has been determined over the past five years to make it a public issue and to bring it to the attention of international institutions , as well as governments like that of Canada , with a view to encouraging action to begin to combat it . 
it is worth pointing out why we are concerned about corruption . 
when Transparency International was formed many of the leaders came from the World Bank . 
some retired early from that institution in order to make corruption a public issue at a time that the World Bank was not paying attention to it . 
they were concerned for three reasons . 
first , particularly in developing countries , corruption distorts public policy . 
it leads governments to make decisions that are not in the public interest but are , rather , in the interest of the people who will collect the bribes when the policy is effected and purchases are made . 
we now know that is the case . 
research has established quite clearly that it has this distorting effect . 
one of the important effects is that it moves money from what we call the soft side of the economy , that is , health , education and social welfare , into projects such as highways and military expenditures such as bridges , and so on . 
it is much easier to pass bribes when you are dealing with those kinds of projects than when you are dealing with things such as health or education . 
this is one of the significant distorting impacts that exists for poorer countries . 
that second impact , which is a significant one , and we often loose track of it in our part of the world , is that it lowers the quality of goods and services provided by the private sector in the course of meeting their contracts . 
it comes either by short - changing the countries with which you have a contract or by undermining the quality of the goods and services that you are offering in return for your contracts . 
this is an established fact and has a significant impact on the quality of services that people in developing countries receive from their tax dollars and also from the international aid that their governments receive . 
finally , and extremely important , corruption undermines government . 
it undermines the development of competent political and democratic institutions . 
where they are in the course of development , it blocks that development . 
this problem has been recognized by the Canadian International Development Agency , to use one example . 
good governance is one of the tools that we are now promoting in Canada as a way to begin to deal with the problem of corruption . 
the OECD convention is the second most powerful tool in this respect . 
transparency International is an international anti - corruption coalition that has chapters formed or forming in 70 countries around the world . 
we are a genuinely international organization . 
our international secretariat focuses on marshalling public opinion around the world against corruption , and we have been effective in doing that . 
we work with international institutions such as the World Bank , the IMF and the United Nations around the world to develop anti - corruption programs . 
we also organize missions to countries whose governments request assistance in confronting domestic corruption . 
that is one of our tasks and one of the ones that we perform most effectively . 
we organize international anti - corruption conventions whose purpose it is to provide an opportunity for countries to come together and discuss the problems that corruption causes . 
the national chapters are semi - autonomous . 
we work under a policy umbrella , but they take up the fight against corruption in creative ways in their own countries . 
frequently it requires substantial courage and almost always it requires ingenuity . 
there are some remarkable things that are being done by our chapters , particularly in Third World countries . 
there are extremely interesting things happening in Bangladesh , as in Chile and Argentina . 
i could go into some detail on that if you are interested . 
it is quite clear that these countries are putting corruption on the public agenda just as the international agency is putting corruption on the agenda in international institutions with organizations like the OECD . 
transparency International has played a significant role in encouraging the creation of the OECD convention . 
it was one of our objectives . 
we devoted enormous energy to it and we have had a positive role in the emergence of that convention . 
the convention was signed in December of last year , and it was an event of real importance because it signalled , for the first time , a collective resolve on the part of the industrialized world to address the issue . 
earlier in the discussion with Minister Axworthy , someone pointed to the fact that for a considerable period of time , and until recently , corruption has been thought of as being a Third World problem . 
any time it was discussed in the industrialized world , it was a finger - pointing exercise . 
that is an extremely important issue for Transparency International and for the credibility of the international anti - corruption movement . 
this convention is a powerful signal to the developing world and will provide enormous symbolic support for people in the Third World , who can now turn and say , " This is a partnership and we are now able to work with the industrialized world to deal with the problem of corruption . " 
our companies will be required to respect our rules and , it is hoped , communicate these values as they do business in the Third World . 
with the convention , corruption will be recognized as a shared responsibility . 
that is an important step . 
i want to talk briefly about the convention and then the legislation that you have before you . 
the convention is an excellent one . 
it is a marvellous first step . 
however , it is only a first step , as others have mentioned . 
nevertheless , it is an important first step . 
it covers direct and indirect bribery . 
it calls for significant penalties for corporations and their agents . 
it is important that corporations are covered ; it is not altogether clear in the legislation , but it is the case . 
the convention also calls for careful international monitoring of the implementation process . 
that is extremely important because this is not a piece of legislation that will be passed and then deposited . 
this is a piece of legislation that people around the world will be looking at . 
they will want to know how countries like Canada are implementing the legislation , how effective they are in their efforts and they will be evaluating that legislation and calling for improvements where they are necessary . 
it is our view that the proposed Canadian legislation meets Canada ' s obligations under the convention . 
that is extremely important . 
we made it clear in our dealings with the government that we would not support the proposed legislation unless , in our view , it met our obligations under the convention . 
we want Canada to be a leader in the implementation of this convention . 
it is our view that this proposed legislation succeeds in that respect . 
that is extremely important . 
although time has been limited , I have been able to consult broadly with colleagues in Canada and elsewhere . 
i am convinced that the legislation will find broad support in Canada and internationally . 
i have consulted with my colleague , Mr. Davies , the business and legal communities and with my colleagues internationally in Transparency International . 
there is a solid response in every case . 
people are absolutely delighted that Canada is moving on this particular issue . 
transparency International - Canada strongly supports the legislation and urges that you pass it as requested and that we move on to the next stage . 
i shall sum up by making the following comments . 
first , if Canada does not ratify by December 31 , it is almost certain that the convention will not come into effect and we will not meet the conditions for entry into force of the convention . 
it is absolutely crucial that Canada ratify the convention by that date . 
once ratified , I would suggest that it is important that Parliament play a role in monitoring the implementation of the legislation . 
we want to see Parliament play a role in monitoring the legislation by way of progress reports and debate on those progress reports . 
i can assure you that Transparency International will be watching your debate as well as participating publicly in it . 
third , we urge Parliament to encourage the Canadian government to play a leadership role in ensuring a strong monitoring role for the OECD . 
this is a rather unusual convention in as much as it calls for the committee that advised on the creation of this convention to continue in a monitoring role . 
it is unfortunate but true that there are countries in the OECD which are dragging their feet on this . 
i should perhaps tell you , to give you some indication , that there were countries that signed the convention in December of last year that , as they signed the convention , had laws on their books which allowed their companies to deduct bribes as legitimate business expenses in their countries . 
that simply indicates where we are and where we need to go and why this convention is as important as it is . 
the first step will be to eradicate that kind of law in countries in Western Europe in particular . 
finally , we want the Canadian and OECD monitoring to be transparent . 
this will be extremely important . 
we do not want it to take place behind closed doors . 
when it occurs , we want it to be transparent , and we want it to be open to the participation of the voluntary sector as well as the private sector . 
we do not want this to be a purely government activity . 
we want the private sector involved in the monitoring process , as well as the voluntary sector , and particularly organizations like Transparency International . 
we invite you to urge the government to carry that message forward and to ensure that it takes place . 
for our part , Transparency International proposes to join with other OECD country chapters in monitoring the implementation of the convention . 
a worldwide committee of Transparency International is coordinating the efforts of chapters like Transparency International - Canada and is already following closely what is happening in various countries and bringing pressure to bear . 
the Canadian chapter has been actively pushing the government to table this legislation and to move it forward and it will continue in that role as time goes on . 
we have a program planned to bring the legislation to the attention of the business community and the public at large . 
we are committed to ensuring that the business community is aware of this legislation and its importance . 
we will be encouraging the corporate sector to develop programs to ensure that the legislation is respected in their activities , both with respect to the letter of the legislation and also with respect to the spirit . 
we will be active . 
this legislation will not just die . 
to the contrary , it is absolutely crucial that it be implemented , as a first step , and that it be monitored to ensure that it does the job that it is supposed to do . 
i will close now by saying that this is an extremely important piece of legislation , much more important than might appear to be the case from the perspective of a country like Canada at this point in history . 
countries around the world are watching Canada now , and it is a remarkable opportunity for Canada to provide leadership both in the next week and also in the future . 
Mr. Michael Davies , my colleague , wishes to make some comments about the position of the business community specifically with regard to this legislation . 
Mr. Michael N . Davies , Vice - President , General Counsel and Secretary , GE Canada : 
the Canadian business community is an active financial supporter of and actively involved in TI Canada . 
among our charter members , in addition to my own company , are Alcan , Northern Telecom , The Globe and Mail , IBM , Placer Dome , Ontario Hydro International , and others . 
the business community in Canada is actively involved in the activities of Transparency International and supports and believes in those activities . 
i wear and have worn another hat in connection with the OECD convention . 
approximately two years ago , the Canadian Council of International Business established a new committee called the " Committee on Corruption and Bribery , " and they asked me if I would chair that committee . 
over the past two years , I have regularly attended meetings of the ICC and OECD working group on corruption in Paris , providing strong input and support from the Canadian business community to ensure that we had a strong and effective convention . 
more and more Canadian companies are now developing , as you likely know , international or global codes of ethical conduct . 
more and more Canadian companies are walking away from contracts rather than getting involved in paying bribes in the international arena . 
that is one of the reasons we so strongly support this convention . 
not only is it one of the most significant steps forward in fighting and dealing with the damage that corruption causes in Third World countries , but it will also help to create a level playing field for the Canadian business community where we can compete fairly in the world on the basis of quality , price , and service and not face competition that is much more willing , potentially , to pay bribes than we are . 
as Minister Axworthy mentioned , in order for the convention to become effective , five of the top 10 trading countries in the OECD must ratify before the end of this year . 
four of those countries have ratified ; some other countries not within the top ten have ratified . 
along with TI and through TI and independently , the business community , CCIB , and the Canadian Chamber of Commerce , we have been contacting representatives and writing to representatives of the government and the opposition parties and speaking to many of you , urging the Canadian Parliament to bring this into effect and put it on a fast track in order to have it passed through both Houses of Parliament before the end of the year so that the convention will come into effect at that time . 
having come into effect , to answer a question that was asked earlier this afternoon , the impetus that this will then provide to bring other countries into signing the convention would be amazing . 
at the last meeting of the OECD that I attended approximately a month ago in Paris , a status report was given by all of the political representatives of the 29 OECD countries . 
we were not party to that , but it was summarized for us subsequently . 
each country was called upon to report where they were in the implementation of the convention , what their plan was , their process , their timing , and their scheduling . 
the peer pressure that is brought to bear within the meetings of the OECD convention will be tremendous , particularly if the convention is brought into effect , as it is scheduled to be , by the end of this year . 
the next meeting of the ministers of the OECD takes place in May . 
at that point , every country will have to report on where it is . 
something else that was mentioned , which is very important and which we promoted within TI and the business community , is that the OECD working group , having brought the convention into place , will not just walk away . 
there is an OECD working group monitoring the process . 
therefore , the risk of countries passing hollow legislation without enforcement is minimized . 
i thank honourable senators on behalf of the CCIB , the Chamber of Commerce and the business community for your efforts in supporting this legislation and bringing it forward on a fast - track basis so that Canada can put it into effect and be an international leader in this area . 
the Chairman : 
thank you both for your presentations . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
i am delighted that colleagues have had the opportunity to hear from these two witnesses about the work of Transparency International . 
i became more familiar with their work by chance last spring when I read an article on its founder , a former senior official of the World Bank who had seen so much international bribery and corruption that he decided something had to be done about it . 
in only a few years , as was explained , TI has taken a lead - if not the lead - in developing conventions and legislation to try to put a halt to this terrible practice . 
it is an NGO of which we have reason to be proud here in Canada . 
i congratulate Mr. Cragg and Mr. Davies and thank them for coming here this afternoon . 
now that we are on - side , the convention is safe and it is to be hoped that the next few years will show positives results . 
senator Grafstein : 
i wish to join Senator Lynch - Staunton in commending Transparency International and its NGO here in Canada . 
appendix 5 of that report is a comprehensive list of human rights violations relating to the 16 countries or states in that region . 
that material all came from two sources ; the U.S. State Department , which does an annual human rights report review country by country ; and the Human Rights Watch World Report , which also does that on an annual basis . 
is the intention of Transparency International to do a country - by - country report on an annual basis , or is that already being done ? 
Mr. Cragg : 
the association you have made between human rights and corruption is an important one . 
although it does not relate directly to your question , I wish to emphasize that there is increasing concern about the impact of corruption on the respect for human rights . 
transparency International is becoming a leader in articulating those concerns and in moving people to understand that respect for human rights and corruption are closely connected . 
we must work on both fronts . 
with respect to monitoring countries , yes , we currently have something called the Corruption Perceptions Index , of which some of you will perhaps be aware . 
this is quite a sophisticated analysis of the perception of corruption in different countries around the world . 
we rank those countries in our index . 
it is an extremely influential analysis that is used around the world . 
it has had quite an impact on countries that find themselves close to the bottom of the list , as well as others . 
it is worth noting that Canada has consistently appeared at the top of the list ; that is to say , it is one of the countries in which corruption is perceived to be not a great problem . 
we should be proud of that . 
that is one of the analyses that we do . 
we are in the process of forming another analysis . 
we have been criticized for that one , particularly by people from the developing world , most of the countries of which find themselves at the bottom of the list . 
the criticism is that it is a finger - pointing exercise and that we are not acknowledging , in our Corruptions Perceptions Index , the role of the industrialized world in promoting corruption . 
we are in the process of developing what we are calling a Corruption Propensity Index , which will rank countries according to the inclination of their companies to engage in corruption . 
the results of that analysis will be surprising and quite uncomfortable . 
this is another way in which Transparency International is trying to ensure that appropriate pressure is applied to both the countries supplying the bribes and those receiving them . 
senator Kinsella : 
Mr. Cragg , in the paper you gave in Bangkok five weeks ago on human rights and business ethics , you drew from Ghandi . 
you referred to the fact that we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights this year . 
indeed , next week will be a special week as we approach December 10 . 
you wrote that we need to remind ourselves , as Gandhi and others have pointed out , that wealth without work and commerce without conscience are formulas for human exploitation , not human development . 
would you share with us your view of the relationship of this kind of initiative - both the convention and the legislation with which we are now dealing - to your view ? 
Mr. Cragg : 
that is a complex question . 
all senators are welcome to read that paper , should they wish to do so . 
corruption is just one element in the process . 
it is quite clear that companies that engage in corruption show considerable contempt for the rights and the status of the people who are being corrupted ; both those receiving the bribes and those damaged by them . 
we frequently do not realize this . 
as well , we do not realize that the suppliers of bribes are actually involved in the encouragement of bribery . 
we tend to think that there are people always willing to take bribes and that the bribers are simply responding to something placed before them . 
that is not the case . 
companies will frequently offer bribes where none are being requested , particularly if they believe that bribery is prevalent . 
it becomes very difficult for people , particularly public servants , not to accept bribes when their colleagues are being bribed . 
it is very difficult to stand up under that pressure . 
we are hoping that this legislation will encourage corporations to look at the values around which they are building their corporate enterprises and to ask themselves whether these are appropriate values . 
the anti - corruption effort will certainly ask them to look at the way in which they treat the people with whom they deal , particularly in the developing world . 
we hope , as Michael Davies has already suggested , that this will encourage corporations to develop codes of ethics which , among other things , will provide guidance to their people , their agents and their employees to ensure that they stay away from questionable activities . 
it is also the case that there are clauses in this bill which can be interpreted narrowly and broadly . 
facilitation payments are a problem . 
they are in the bill and we recognize that that is appropriate , but we also want corporations to move on that front . 
we think that this bill will encourage them to look at the values that are operating , to develop codes , and to provide guidance for their employees and agents which will lead them to a higher ethical standard of business conduct . 
senator Kinsella : 
this chamber of Parliament has a good track record of carefully analyzing proposed legislation . 
we can fast - track this particular bill because we have already done a lot of work in this area . 
reference has been made to the work of Senator Stewart and his committee . 
other committees and individual members of this place have been studying this area for some time . 
i expect that this bill will be passed in the Senate today , but I cannot anticipate what will happen in the House of Commons , because we have no control over what goes on there . 
my reading of the convention is that Canada can ratify that convention ; indeed , Canada could do so this afternoon or tomorrow morning . 
my reading of it also suggests that it is not necessary to have this particular bill enacted by Parliament in order for Canada to ratify the convention . 
therefore , if the bill is slowed down in the other place , would your organization not see it as a good tactic to pressure the government to deposit the instrument of ratification pursuant to section 14 of the convention so that we can still be the fifth country to bring the convention into operation ? 
Mr. Davies : 
we would certainly be delighted if the government were to do that . 
indeed , earlier we inquired of the government whether that might be possible if the legislation were not to go through . 
the explanation given to us , similar to that provided by Minister Axworthy today , was that , to the extent that ratification of the convention involves an obligation to pass legislation , it is something the government hesitates to do without Parliament actually having passed the bill . 
since Parliament has the right to do what it wants , there is a reluctance to purport to commit Parliament in that way . 
i do not purport to understand the legalities of the matter , but that is the explanation that was given to us . 
i might say that we are fairly confident and believe that it will go through the House of Commons next week . 
wearing our Transparency International hat , we have written to all members of opposition in Parliament seeking their support , as have the Canadian Council for International Business and the Canadian Chamber of Commerce . 
we hope to have fast - track passage through the House of Commons next week . 
if it does not , and if there were any way to convince the government that Canada could ratify nonetheless , we would be delighted to do that . 
Mr. Cragg : 
we will take your advice . 
we certainly want to follow any path that would lead to ratification by the end of December , and we will certainly listen closely to recommendations that come from senators on that subject . 
if this bill passes , it will pass with the full support of the Canadian Parliament . 
the symbolism of the ratification of Canada under these circumstances - both for our own business community and for the international community - will be greatly enhanced , in my view . 
Mr. Davies : 
i concur in the thoughts expressed by my friend . 
senator Joyal : 
i should like to commend our two witnesses this afternoon . 
could you tell us how you recruit your membership in Canada ? 
can you tell us from which walks of life members of Transparency International are recruited ? 
in other words , what is the kind of membership you hope for ? 
Mr. Cragg : 
transparency International is a voluntary - sector organization or NGO . 
it has a number of different categories of membership . 
our membership comprises individuals from all walks of life : academics , professionals , business people , people who have no particular profession , people who are retired . 
we have a substantial individual membership . 
we have a category of membership for organizations , including voluntary organizations and government departments , if they wish to join - and some have . 
for example , the ethics counsellor ' s department is a member of Transparency International . 
we also have corporations which are members . 
we have two categories of membership at the top end . 
one is for just simply organizational membership but there is also provision for charter membership . 
charter members commit to $ 10,000 over two years to ensure the financial stability of the organization . 
we have quite a number of charter members . 
the board of Transparency International is comprised of members from the business community , academics , members from the voluntary sector , and professionals . 
we are attempting to create a balanced board which resembles a variety of perspectives and is also representative , both geographically and linguistically . 
we have francophone and anglophone members , as well as colleagues from across the country . 
senator Joyal : 
could you give us a rough idea of your membership , in all classes ? 
Mr. Cragg : 
i should know but I have been distracted over the last few weeks by these matters . 
i believe we have between 50 and 100 individual members and between 10 and 20 , perhaps more , organizational members of Transparency International at the present time . 
senator Joyal : 
i should like to move on with a question on the bill itself . 
you might have heard my questions to the Minister of Foreign Affairs earlier this afternoon concerning subclause 3 ( 3 ) ( a ) , which gives a blessing to activities that would be allowed , permitted or required under the laws of the foreign state . 
you said in your presentation that there are some countries around the world wherein you expect the legislation to be changed because some behaviour or acts that would be subject to reprimand under Canadian legislation would be allowed in those countries . 
are you satisfied that such an interpretation of the bill would be considered a loophole ? 
considering the objective of your group and your plea to us today to pass the bill as it stands , are you comfortable with that interpretation of that particular subclause ? 
Mr. Cragg : 
the basic response is that we would be comfortable with the legislation as a first step . 
we want the bill to pass . 
whether these various components of it are adequate is something we will have to examine as it goes along . 
we will be watching closely . 
if we think clauses such as this are not adequate , then we will recommend amendments to the Canadian government . 
we will do that as quickly as is necessary . 
this is an area of interest to me . 
i am not aware of any country in the world that does not have anti - corruption legislation on the books . 
corruption is not legal and bribery is not legal any place in the world of which I am aware . 
the real question is how efficiently the law is enforced . 
we want to encourage the Canadian business community not to take advantage of countries where enforcement is problematic . 
that will be one of our objectives . 
we will also be working with chapters around the world . 
it is important to recognize that this is a worldwide effort to support them in strengthening legislation in their own jurisdictions . 
i can assure you that this is already going on . 
as I say , we are part of a worldwide effort . 
we will be monitoring the Canadian compliance to it and the effectiveness of Canadian legislation . 
we are happy that this step is being taken , and we think it is such an enormous first step that we want to support it in all aspects . 
Mr. Davies : 
the main problem internationally is not that the laws do not exist , but that they are not enforced in some countries . 
the OECD working group did a study of the laws that exist around the world and generally confirmed that bribery is an offence in every country . 
however , in some countries they do not pay any attention to it , or the judiciary is controlled by the state and it is not applied . 
it is a specific provision in the convention , as agreed to by the various countries , that it would not be an offence if the advantage were permitted or required by the written law of the domestic country . 
the legislation is in conformity with the convention . 
senator Joyal : 
many parliamentary associations deal with various regions of the world , such as the Commonwealth , the Francophonie , the North American and South American groups , and so on . 
personally , I feel in the forthcoming months in our international meetings that we should make a point on the agendas of all those parliamentary associations to raise the issue of this convention so that the objective of this convention is placed on almost the same footing as human rights . 
you made the association between the two . 
this is a means of establishing better respect for individuals . 
you heard the question we put to the minister , namely , what kind of initiative we could take after the passage of this legislation by both Houses of Parliament to improve the implementation and fostering of that convention . 
do you have other suggestions to make today in order that we can achieve those objectives ? 
Mr. Cragg : 
transparency International is active in those various associations or with respect to those governments . 
the next step is to urge the government to move on the OAS convention . 
canada has an opportunity with respect to the FTAA work that is currently going on . 
canada has remarkable opportunities to advance the agenda because it finds itself in a chairmanship role . 
one of our colleagues on the board , Arthur Kruger , who is in the gallery , has been assigned specific responsibility for tracking Canada ' s response to the OAS anti - corruption convention . 
we want Parliament to urge the government now to move on that front as well . 
we are also working collectively with Transparency International colleagues in appropriate chapters on APEC . 
we have a committee working at that level . 
here , again , we want to see Canadian leadership , and I think Canada is in a position to provide it . 
we are working wherever there are associations of that sort . 
transparency International forms groups designed to push their individual countries to advance the anti - corruption agenda . 
the OAS and APEC fora are extremely important . 
we have also urged Canadian representatives in international financial institutions to pay particular attention to the anti - corruption agenda . 
we have executives on the board of the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund , the Asian Development Bank and similar institutions . 
that is another extremely important area . 
we would like to see those international organizations thinking creatively about how they can encourage the development of an anti - corruption agenda in their activities . 
Mr. Davies : 
this is another area where Transparency International and the Canadian business community are operating in cooperation with each other in an attempt to achieve these ends in other parts of the world . 
the Canadian committee of the Pacific Basin Economic Council was instrumental about two years ago in establishing a transparency committee within PBEC . 
its first chairman was a gentleman from Placer Dome in Vancouver who had to step down last May . 
i was asked if I would take on the chairmanship of the PBEC committee on transparency where we are attempting , in cooperation with Transparency International - Canada and Transparency International internationally , to bring transparency into the Asian community by signing on to the OECD convention . 
we are also attempting to develop a tight form of regional agreement on transparency and government procurement either in APEC or the WTO . 
again , it is another area where the business community in Canada and Transparency International - Canada are closely working together to spread this transparency initiative further around the world . 
senator Atkins : 
does Transparency International believe the penalties are tough enough in this legislation ? 
Mr. Cragg : 
that is an interesting question . 
determining what counts as a " tough penalty " is difficult . 
our view is that , yes , it is an indictable offence . 
it is sufficiently tough that it would make any executive that I know of stand up and take notice . 
if you are the CEO of a company , five years in prison is pretty significant punishment . 
it is also the case that by virtue of the way in which this piece of legislation connects with the Criminal Code , as I understand it , corporations will be liable to fines of an indefinite size . 
there is no limit on the size of fine a court can impose on a corporation if it is in breach of this law . 
i think that is significant as well . 
corporations will face significant financial risk if they do not respect this legislation . 
the short answer is , yes , I think this is an appropriate move with respect to penalties . 
in addition , we would like to see the government thinking more about how it can provide positive incentives rather than after - the - fact punishment , and how they can encourage corporations to put in place compliance programs that will , in turn , lead to less inclination to engage in this behaviour . 
we will be talking to the government about that over the coming months . 
senator Stewart : 
as honourable senators will know , I am uneasy about some of these conventions because representatives of government have signed them in good faith , and then it turns out that they do not have the ability to deliver the fulfilment of the convention . 
when the Minister of Foreign Affairs was here , I asked a question concerning the impact of this proposed legislation on Canadians trying to do business in other countries . 
Mr. Cragg : 
first , this will be carefully monitored . 
countries that are lax in their enforcement of the convention will be criticized publicly and internationally by both Transparency International and the OECD monitoring committee . 
i want to put a different spin on it . 
i get very uncomfortable when people suggest that , somehow , dishonest people have an advantage over people who are honest in the business community . 
i do not want to be excessively idealistic but I suggest to you that if Canada creates an environment where corporations are encouraged to conduct honest business , that may very well turn into a positive business advantage for those corporations . 
i do not know of anyone in any country of the world who prefers to do business with a dishonest person or a dishonest corporation . 
corporations who are honest and who are known to be honest have a clear business advantage in many business transactions . 
let us not just think about the advantage of blocking people from dishonest behaviour . 
think about the advantages that come to a business community which is developing appropriate standards of business conduct . 
Mr. Davies : 
our current strong belief is that the Canadian business community is more disadvantaged today than it will be under the convention because more and more Canadian businesses are voluntarily complying with the convention . 
that is the way they do business internationally . 
with the transparency and the corporate governance aspects that we have in Canada , more and more companies have strict codes of conduct . 
there were concerns that one or two countries would sign on to the convention and that the others would do nothing . 
then those countries with the legislation would be disadvantaged . 
that is one reason for the requirement of a minimum of five of the top ten exporting countries to sign before the convention can take effect . 
then the peer pressure will take effect . 
the business community and Transparency International were both active in pushing for an effective ongoing monitoring program . 
we did not have to push too hard ; it was supported all around . 
that program is to ensure that other countries are not only coming onboard but are passing the appropriate legislation and taking steps to enforce it . 
there will be opportunities for monitoring by one country of the activities of another country and that will be ongoing . 
we are confident that , within the business community , we will be much better off under the convention and able to engage in business the way we desire , which is on a level playing field . 
senator Andreychuk : 
in light of the late hour , I will not request answers to all of the questions that I have . 
i am aware of Transparency International and its creation . 
i am also familiar with the founder with whom I worked when he was at the World Bank . 
this is my concern . 
so much of the lending in the developed world goes through the World Bank and the IMF to regional lending institutions . 
what role do you foresee for these institutions which have access , information and control over much of the funding ? 
Mr. Cragg : 
briefly , there should be a substantial role , a greater role than is the case presently . 
however , it is worth noting that we have come an enormous distance . 
those institutions are in a position to provide real leadership and to create an environment where companies are encouraged to tackle these kinds of problems and to develop honest corporate cultures . 
i think they can do a good deal . 
we began by having conversations with the Canadian representatives of the international financial institutions . 
canada can provide leadership there as well . 
CIDA is doing that . 
we can only progress on that street . 
i hope you carry that interest forward . 
we would be happy to work with you to encourage these institutions to move on this agenda . 
Mr. Davies : 
transparency International has two or three senior executives or officers who have come out of the World Bank . 
they are active in working with the World Bank and other international funding agencies , as we are with CIDA , to bring better transparency . 
the president of the World Bank is committed to bringing more transparency into the World Bank . 
they now require contractors on World Bank contracts to disclose the amount of commissions that they pay sales representatives on any contract . 
that is one step forward . 
they are looking for other opportunities . 
the International Monetary Fund is beginning to impose conditions and certain governance requirements related to lending in Third World countries . 
they are starting to move slowly , but we will continue with TI and elsewhere to promote that . 
senator Prud ' homme : 
you mentioned a few minutes ago that the convention was signed on January 25 . 
Mr. Cragg : 
yes , that is right . 
senator Prud ' homme : 
today is December 3 , why the wait ? 
a word that I am hearing from everyone is " fast - track . " 
this is December 3 , a Thursday night , and many senators have made a sacrifice and cancelled their flights . 
it is not your fault but I want to know where it is written in the Rules of the Senate that we should take orders that include haste and precipitation ? 
we have two great witnesses who are backing up the minister . 
i am not saying that we could find a contrary witness who would be in favour of corruption , but these are our only witnesses . 
usually we have witnesses who differ with each other . 
my question is whether we could have done this earlier ? 
was there any impediment ? 
Mr. Cragg : 
i cannot answer that question . 
you know the political process better than I. 
senator Prud ' homme : 
yes , but this convention was not drawn up today . 
we will draw our own conclusions . 
i do not want to embarrass you . 
it has been known since January 25 that this was to take place ; is that not correct ? 
Mr. Cragg : 
this is true . 
senator Prud ' homme : 
when did Great Britain , Germany , Japan and the fourth one sign ? 
that may encourage us to hurry up . 
Mr. Cragg : 
this has all been very recent . 
to bring a convention into effect in the course of a year is , in some respects , unrealistic . 
people were critical . 
they worried that they had set the bar too high in that respect . 
countries have had difficulty meeting the time constraint ; there is no question about that . 
canada has also had difficulty meeting the time constraint . 
perhaps it is the case that the bar was set too high . 
the Americans were certainly at the front , but you must remember that they had a foreign corrupt practices act already in place and it was just a matter of amending that . 
the others acted very recently . 
senator Prud ' homme : 
you talk about the OAS , the OECD and so many organizations . 
is it not the responsibility of the United Nations to ensure the convention is applied , honoured and followed ? 
the United Nations has all the means at its disposal . 
senator Joyal spoke of parliamentary associations . 
each association plays the role of the UN instead of being concerned strictly with the reason it was created . 
the associations also become responsible for human rights . 
could I suggest , for further consideration , that it become the responsibility of a committee or the United Nations ? 
Mr. Cragg : 
the broad answer is " yes . " 
the United Nations has been trying to address the issue of corruption since the 1970 s . 
quite recently , the United Nations took up the issue again . 
we must look to whoever will be most affected in the particular framework in which we are working . 
the importance of this particular action is that it is the industrialized countries getting together to make a decision which applies to them . 
it is difficult for the United Nations to point the finger at a single group of countries in the way in which the OECD can . 
in this case , this is an appropriate initiative for the OECD . 
i encourage Parliament to support the efforts of the United Nations in this direction . 
senator Prud ' homme : 
earlier , a senator mentioned a report by the American Congress on abusers of human rights in the world . 
i am sceptical about that report . 
i remember when a lobby firm was hired to ensure that Turkey would not be singled out by a congressman in California who , in fact succeeded in having Turkey withdrawn from the list . 
i take it that you will be strict with those who are guilty of abuse . 
Mr. Cragg : 
we promise , senator .

hon. Eymard G . Corbin : 
honourable senators , the Committee of the Whole , to which was referred Bill S - 21 , respecting the corruption of foreign public officials and the implementation of the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions , and to make related amendments to other Acts , has examined the said bill and has directed me to report the same to the Senate without amendment .

hon. Lucie P é pin : 
with leave , now , honourable senators . 
the Hon. the Acting Speaker : 
it is moved by the Honourable Senator P é pin , seconded by the Honourable Senator Joyal that , with leave of the Senate and notwithstanding rule 58 ( 1 ) ( b ) , the bill be read the third time now . 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
motion in Amendment 
hon. John Lynch - Staunton ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I move : 
that Bill S - 21 be amended on page 6 
( a ) by adding the following after line 35 ; 
" annual REPORT 
12 . Within four months of the end of each fiscal year , the Minister of Foreign Affairs , the Minister for International Trade and the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada shall jointly prepare a report on the implementation of the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions , and on the enforcement of this Act , and the Minister of Foreign Affairs shall cause a copy of the report to be laid before each House of Parliament on any of the first fifteen days on which that House is sitting after the report is completed . " ; 
the Hon. the Acting Speaker : 
honourable senators , is it your pleasure to adopt the motion in amendment ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
third Reading 
the Hon. the Acting Speaker : 
when shall this bill , as amended , be read the third time ? 
hon. Lucie P é pin : 
the Hon. the Acting Speaker : 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
hon. Marcel Prud ' homme : 
honourable senators , I wish to thank you for your patience . 
after 35 years I have been through too many bad experiences with fast - tracked bills in the other chamber . 
i strongly object that a bill of such importance should be dealt with in this way . 
i am not blaming the leadership in this regard . 
it is a fact of life . 
however , some senator should stand up to say that this is not the way to conduct the affairs of the Senate . 
this is an important bill which has come to us at the last minute . 
it has been fast - tracked . 
there were times when , in the other chamber , I should have said " no " to such requests . 
however , we did fast - track some bills , and we have had to live with those pieces of legislation for a long time . 
i know that other bills will be fast - tracked . 
i agree that it is important for our reputation that the world know that Canada stands in the forefront of honesty , as if it will change the human race and human habits . 
if someone has decided to be corrupt , they already know how to bypass this bill . 
it has come to the Senate and I do not know how it will go to the House of Commons . 
it only takes one senator to say no third reading today and then it will go to Tuesday of next week . 
there is no other way if you know that the House , most likely , will adjourn Thursday night of next week . 
this is not the way to do this . 
who will dare object ? 
there is no risk of being unpopular , is there ? 
i will not call for a vote because I have someone who has agreed to push for a vote . 
i do not need a seconder . 
i want that division to be well registered as coming from me , unless there are others who will join me . 
the Hon. the Acting Speaker : 
is it in your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
some Hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
some Hon. Senators : 
on division . 
motion agreed to and bill as amended read third time and passed , on division . 
the Senate adjourned during pleasure .

family Violence 
inquiry - Debate Continued 
on the Order : 
resuming debate on the inquiry of the Honourable Senator Carstairs calling the attention of the Senate to the magnitude of family violence in our society and , in particular , the need for collaborative efforts to seek solutions to the various aspects of this form of violence . 
- ( honourable Senator Robertson ) . 
hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , I should like to commend Senator Carstairs for initiating this inquiry and speaking so eloquently to the definition of violence , its pervasiveness in our society , and for pointing out avenues that could lead to solutions . 
noting the anniversary on December 6 of the É cole polytechnique massacre in Montreal , and alluding to her own tragedy , she demonstrated that this is an issue for all Canadians and the key to its solution lies with all of us . 
i wish to underscore a few points that Senator Carstairs mentioned . 
in all the years that I served in family court or , for that matter , in criminal court , family violence was the least understood and the most horrific occurrence in our society . 
after 10 years in family court , nightmare cases still haunt me with little explanation of how such unspeakable cruelty can be allowed to occur . 
time and time again , I witnessed pictures and actual children in my courtroom who had been deformed by cigarette butts , had arms twisted or bodies beaten , or who were emaciated from lack of food . 
again , when this child returned and the mother attempted to remove the woolen mittens against frost - bitten hands , that had been laced with the salve , the skin was literally torn off the hands of the child , permanently mutilating and disabling the child . 
i used to go home wishing , hoping and praying , that these were isolated incidents . 
however , every day and every week there was another case , another fact situation and another child destroyed . 
i witnessed women in common - law , marital and in casual associations degraded , beaten and violated and , as Senator Carstairs pointed out , I saw men demeaned , and in a few isolated cases , beaten by so - called loved ones . 
unless we think that this is a Canadian or North American phenomena , my years abroad in Africa and Europe proved to me that we are not alone in violence . 
in many countries , these issues become silent , unspeakable and unacknowledged by governments and community leaders . 
i am pleased that in Canada efforts are being taken to identify these issues because the roots of violence are many and often rooted in history , culture and the attitudes of the people . 
there is no single cause of violence and even when the cause of violence can be identified , proposing solutions becomes a complex , costly and difficult matter . 
therefore , an interdisciplinary approach is necessary . 
i am pleased to support the Prairie Action Foundation in its campaign to support the Prairie Research Network which is operating in Saskatchewan , Manitoba and Alberta and focuses on collaborative , practical and broad - based research into the prevention of violence and abuse , in the evaluation of traditional solutions and the development of new ones , and in public education to break the conspiracy of silence in our homes , schools and workplaces . 
i commend Senator Carstairs for her dedication and persistence and others who have persisted despite odds to forge a new prairie alliance on this initiative . 
there are two issues that must be addressed if we are able to make any inroads into the prevention of violence in families . 
it is important to break the cycle of violence . 
repeatedly , violence was known to be used as a weapon because it was a weapon used previously against the perpetrator . 
in so many cases that I dealt with where excess of discipline was used , investigation into the parental background disclosed that violence was part of their upbringing . 
intervention is necessary to stop this repeated acceptance of violence as a mode of behaviour . 
while this is easier said than done , strategies for intervention , assistance and behaviour modification are necessary . 
victims must also be given the support , protection and assistance to gain the strength to avoid , leave or overcome violent action perpetrated on them . 
a combination of enforcement through the laws , education and community is needed . 
violent behaviour must not be tolerated , hidden or excused . 
what is perplexing to me is that while we through our political leaders and educators reject violence , we nonetheless contribute and encourage a culture of violence . 
while we see through organizations such as International Alert , that organization which studies children in conflict situations , namely wars and civil insurrection , and through the eloquent report of Mrs. Machel for the United Nations , speaking to children as soldiers was highlighted and brought to the attention of the world , we easily condemn these actions on behalf of young children and the devastation it causes them , robbing them of any hope of real and valued efforts for peaceful coexistence in their societies . 
nonetheless , in our own society , one need only look around to see what is the prevailing current culture that supports and encourages violence . 
we need only to go to a hockey rink to see the behaviour of parents or watch physical altercations rather than sporting prowess take over our national sport . 
one only needs to look at the Internet , videos , rap music or current movies to see that violence has its cachet in our society . 
too often brute strength is equated to power in our society . 
my concern is the growing number of extremely young children using violence in inappropriate ways such as aggressiveness in schoolyards and intimidation . 
perhaps , as society lives with these new technologies , we will see the long - term side effects . 
if we as a Canadian society say that we do not tolerate family violence , it is incumbent upon us to do more than mere words . 
as we note the anniversary of the massacre at the É cole polytechnique , in Montreal , we should all stop and take stock of our own behaviour and dedication to this cause . 
i hope in some small measure this inquiry , spurred by Senator Carstairs , will spur us to take action to curb the cycles of silence and reject the culture of violence . 
on motion of Senator Kinsella , for Senator Robertson , debate adjourned . 
legal and Constitutional Affairs 
committee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
hon. Lorna Milne , pursuant to notice of December 2 , 1998 , moved : 
that the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs have power to sit on Monday , December 7 , 1998 , even though the Senate may then be sitting , and that rule 95 ( 4 ) be suspended in relation thereto . 
hon. No ë l A . Kinsella ( Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I should like to have an explanation of the motion . 
senator Milne : 
honourable senators , the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee has planned for quite some time to meet all day next Monday . 
when it was announced that the Senate would be sitting that day , I was not concerned because when we sit on Mondays , we normally sit at eight o ' clock in the evening . 
however , when the sitting was scheduled for four o ' clock in the afternoon in order to accommodate the Christmas plans of the Conservative Party , which I totally support , we had a problem with the previously agreed upon appearance before the committee of the new Solicitor General . 
i generally do not approve of committees sitting while the Senate is sitting but , because of this previously planned appearance and because there is no other time at which the minister can make himself available , I am asking for permission for the committee to sit even though the Senate may then be sitting . 
senator Kinsella : 
i thank the Honourable Senator Milne for that explanation . 
i agree that the committee should be allowed to sit even though the Senate will be sitting at that time . 
however , I will agree to it only for the purpose of the committee hearing the minister and not for the conduct of any other business . 
if necessary , honourable senators , I will move an amendment to that motion . 
that will not be necessary if there is agreement . 
the Hon. the Acting Speaker : 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
motion agreed to .

the Honourable Jean B . Forest 
tributes on Retirement 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , Lewis Carroll ' s famous masterpiece , Through the Looking - Glass , had a lot of important reflections on life and the human condition . 
one of them , and one of my favourites , which I like to tell my grandchildren about , is a story about dreaming the impossible dream . 
there is a little conversation between Alice and the Queen in which Alice laughs and says , " There ' s no use trying . 
one can ' t believe impossible things . " 
the Queen responds , " I dare say you haven ' t had much practice . 
when I was your age , I believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast . " 
to dream the impossible dream . 
how else do we account for the wonderful life of Senator Jean Forest , our distinguished colleague and friend who has added so much to this place and now has left us too soon . 
however , she has returned and is present with us in the gallery today . 
hon. Senators : 
hear , hear ! 
senator Graham : 
jean Forest began work as a 17 - year - old teacher , teaching grade 12 students who probably were not much older than she was and probably not a whole lot taller either . 
she would go on to become chairman of the Edmonton Catholic School Board and later Chancellor of the University of Alberta . 
she was an original member of the Alberta Human Rights Commission and latterly , a member of the Dignity Foundation . 
as an influential board member of Canadian National , she was , prior to her appointment to the Senate of Canada , deeply involved in the privatization of that immense Crown corporation . 
jean has served on government advisory committees and has been a winner of many honorary degrees . 
she is , as well , an Officer of the Order of Canada . 
as politician , educator and businesswoman , as a mother of seven and grandmother of 13 - something which you and I share in common , Jean - she has never forgotten the real things in life . 
it was once said that you must learn day by day , year by year to broaden your horizons . 
the more things you love , the more you are interested in , the more you enjoy , the more you are indignant about - the more you have left when anything happens . 
in spite of all the energy she has expended over the years , in spite of all the commitment to service to others , Jean Forest has always had a lot left over - a lot left over in terms of personal courage , a lot left over for those who strive for justice and the promise of a better world . 
she has been an inspiration to us all . 
in this decade , where so many Canadian women try to juggle careers and lifestyles , her common - sense views on life and relationships make the Jean Forest story highly significant in our interminable search for balance in life . 
her belief , her faith and her convictions have always been the cornerstone of her busy life . 
St. Matthew was speaking of the impossible dream and the faith to make this world a better place . 
for Jean Forest , who has always believed at least six impossible things before breakfast , moving mountains has always been only part of a day ' s work . 
jean , we miss you . 
we welcome you back today and we welcome you to come back at any time . 
hon. Senators : 
hear , hear ! 
hon. Mabel M. DeWare : 
honourable senators , I rise with pleasure today to pay tribute to a very special person , Senator Jean Forest . 
i am pleased she could be with us today so she could hear how much she means to her former colleagues on both sides of this chamber . 
i speak today as a friend , an admirer , and also on behalf of my fellow Progressive Conservative senators . 
when the Prime Minister asked her whether she would accept a seat in the Senate , she told him she had a condition . 
jean and her husband were celebrating a very special anniversary that fall . 
she said that she had plans to go away for a couple of weeks and that if she could not continue with those plans she would have to turn down the offer . 
the Prime Minister agreed to that condition , and she joined us in May . 
jean served with distinction for just over two years , until August past . 
during that short time , she was an exemplary member of this chamber . 
her hard work and dedication were an inspiration to us all and she enlivened our debates with the strength of her convictions . 
i have many fond memories of our work together on the Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs , Science and Technology as well as on the Special Senate Committee on Post - Secondary Education . 
i appreciate the valuable contribution that she made . 
she distinguished herself on other Senate committees as well , especially National Finance . 
honourable senators , I want to talk a bit about Jean Forest , not as a senator but as a person . 
although we sat on opposite sides of this chamber , our party affiliations were no barrier between us . 
instead , a friendship developed that I cherish . 
it was helped along by the fact that we were neighbours on the eighth floor of the Victoria Building for a time . 
the warmth of her personality brightened my work days and I looked forward to our chats . 
i liked her enthusiasm and her lively interest in affairs of the Senate , Canada and the world . 
senator Forest and I also share a strong belief in the importance of family . 
she is a proud and loving wife , mother and grandmother . 
while her work in the Senate was always very important to her , her family has always been her highest priority , for which she deserves much respect . 
senator Forest ' s support for her family was at no time more apparent than in her decision to resign from the Senate . 
she made that difficult decision three years before her mandatory retirement and despite some misgivings from her caucus colleagues , but she realized that her husband , who was in poor health , needed her more than her country . 
honourable senators , I know you share my sadness at Senator Forest ' s early departure , and I also know that you will join me in wishing Jean and Rocky all the best as they enjoy their retirement together in their beautiful new home on the West Coast . 
hon. Marie - P . 
honourable senators , we are delighted at the return today of our colleague the Honourable Senator Jean Forest . 
i am in the throes of a dilemma , because I do not know whether I should call her the Honourable Jean Forest or the Honourable Jeanne Forest , because she can say with pride that her family , the Forest family , helped build Western Canada . 
our friend and former colleague contributed to this house a whole lot of humour and dignity . 
as the Leader of the Government , Senator Graham , said , it is always difficult to balance dignity and humour . 
her professional and personal experience went into the wisdom she injected in every matter given her . 
the Honourable Jean Forest left us far too early . 
the choice she made speaks very clearly of her real sense of values , her real priority in life , and we congratulate her on them . 
good luck and especially health and success to you and your family , dear former colleague Jean Forest . 
hon. Th é r è se Lavoie - Roux : 
honourable senators , I am pleased to pay tribute to Senator Jean Forest . 
why not Jeanne Forest ? 
it is a well - known story here in Quebec . 
i think it was her brother - in - law who kicked up a fuss when he received , either in Manitoba or in Alberta , a ticket in English . 
so , I would like to convey to Senator Forest my admiration and gratitude for what she has achieved . 
one thing that struck me about Senator Forest was her impartiality . 
there are very few senators that I know of who are capable of focussing on the real issues without getting entangled in petty partisan disputes . 
her contribution to the Senate committee on secondary education was much appreciated , given her university experience and other professional credentials . 
senator Forest , I for one find it very sad to see you leave so soon , especially under these difficult circumstances . 
we will remember you fondly . 
i hope that future senators will be as open - minded as you are and not get bogged down in disputes that prevent or delay progress on the issues or blow them out of proportion . 
i am sure that , with your children and many grandchildren , your time will be filled with much joy and happiness . 
i do not like to say that you are retiring , because we are never completely retired . 
we retire from one thing only to get involved in another . 
i want to wish you a great deal of happiness and the best of luck , and I will remember you as a quite remarkable senator . 
hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , we are honouring a very special and elegant lady today , Jean Forest . 
she was originally a Manitoban , then an Albertan , and is now a British Columbian , but is , above all , a Canadian . 
i knew Jean only by reputation when she arrived in the Senate . 
i knew of her work on the Human Rights Commission in Alberta . 
she took over my office in room 202 of the Victoria Building so we began an early friendship on the basis of that activity . 
honourable senators , what we bring to this chamber is the experience of a lifetime . 
if we are fortunate enough to bring experience rich in human nature , if we are fortunate enough to bring practical experience of life on boards and commissions and committees , then we will bring the kind of experience that Jean Forest brought to the Senate of Canada . 
for both Jean and I , certainly the Newfoundland schools question was a difficult one . 
both having had experience - she as a trustee , me as a teacher - with separate schools in Western Canada , we were fearful about the future . 
however , in her usual way , logic and reason and a little bit of passion prevailed . 
jean , make sure that Rocky goes regularly for those walks . 
we want you to have him for a very long time . 
take care of him . 
take care of yourself . 
above all , remember you go with our love . 
hon. Dan Hays : 
honourable senators , I would like to add a few words of tribute to the very appropriate and kind things that have been said about Senator Jean Forest . 
we know that those visits to Victoria and other places are just that - visits . 
senator Forest I had known by reputation for most of my life , and now I know her personally . 
she has served with distinction as chancellor of the University of Alberta and in many business and volunteer capacities . 
she has been called upon by the provincial government and the federal government - to wit her appointment to this chamber - to provide her wise counsel and to bring her judgment to bear on difficult and important questions . 
she has done that with great distinction . 
as someone who has served with her in the government caucus of the Alberta senators , she was an extraordinarily effective and helpful representative of those causes . 
she did that work for her region and for her country . 
i will not go on further because it is clear that we have all come to know her and admire her . 
that is true of everyone whose life you have touched . 
jean , the best to you , Rocky and family . 
we look forward to staying in touch . 
we are looking forward also to your continuing contribution to the well - being of our country . 
hon. Gerry St. Germain : 
honourable senators , I , too , want to pay tribute to Senator Jean Forest . 
she was a neighbour of mine in the Victoria Building . 
she has been described as special and elegant . 
there is no question that she is a gracious , dignified and brilliant lady . 
i got to know her by working with her on committees . 
it was an honour . 
i also had the privilege of travelling back and forth to the West Coast as she dealt with the challenge of her husband ' s health . 
i could see that it was taking its toll . 
i knew she would make the right decision and she has . 
she always seems to have everything prioritized correctly . 
i will not go on at great length . 
i just want to say , with great regret , that your stay here was too short . 
god bless you and thank you . 
hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , I also want to pay tribute to Senator Forest for her work here in the Senate and to acknowledge her previous work . 
anyone who was touched by Senator Forest would understand her civility , her charm , her dignity and her compassion for the issues that she championed both in the chamber and in committee meetings . 
i particularly want to acknowledge her work on the Special Senate Committee on Post - Secondary Education . 
no one can go into Alberta without learning of Senator Forest . 
she is known throughout the community college system and the university system . 
she is known for caring for the students , the faculty and the administration , and that is a pretty tough task . 
usually we find ourselves on one side of the issue or the other . 
senator Forest found time to balance the interests of all those who make up our education system . 
she is well respected for that ability . 
we say in the university sector that we try to change one mind at a time . 
well , Senator Forest , throughout Alberta and throughout Canada , has changed many minds for the better in post - secondary education . 
she was also noted in the post - secondary education field for paying great attention to the francophone base in Western Canada . 
as a result of her efforts , we in Western Canada can all be proud to have the francophone base at the University of Regina and , more particularly , at the University of Alberta . 
she was very dedicated to that cause and fought very hard to maintain it as a top priority . 
without her efforts , the post - secondary committee would not have produced the report it did . 
she attended virtually every committee meeting . 
she sat through all of the hearings . 
she brought knowledge to the table that most of us did not have , nor did some of the witnesses . 
she was able to prod witnesses and elicit from them the best for our post - secondary education . 
if it became an issue within the Government of Canada and the Senate that education must be first and foremost , it was because of the perseverance and the knowledge that Senator Forest brought to that issue . 
i , too , believe as Senator Hays has said , that , in her heart , she has not left Alberta . 
i strongly feel that streets and schools and areas within universities will be named after Jean Forest . 
she certainly deserves it . 
i had hoped that she would continue her work in the Senate . 
the few times that I noticed that she was not in the Senate , it was always because of a family issue . 
her family came first and it continues to be first . 
i believe but for that she would be with us and would continue to serve in this chamber . 
we hope you will continue your dedication to post - secondary education . 
thank you , Jean . 
hon. Serge Joyal : 
honourable senators , I want to add my voice to that of my colleagues in paying tribute to Senator Forest . 
i do so after listening to the remarks of Senator Lavoie - Roux . 
i wish to remind this house of the role played by Senator Forest ' s family in the recognition of the linguistic rights of Franco - Manitobans . 
indeed , I was Canada ' s secretary of state in 1982 , when Senator Forest ' s brother - in - law came to see me with a parking ticket in his hands and asked me what he should do with it . 
at the time , we had a court challenges program to help official language minorities go before the courts to seek redress when the provisions of the Charter should have applied . 
after listening to Mr. Forest ' s arguments , I asked the Secretary of State ' s legal services for an opinion on the advisability of providing the necessary funding to Mr. Forest . 
i must say for the sake of history that the legal services were not in favour of supporting Mr. Forest ' s initiative . 
the provisions of the Charter could not invalidate the 1898 Manitoba act that totally prohibited the use of French in Manitoba ' s public documents . 
i reviewed the arguments put forth by the department ' s legal experts . 
since I had a basic knowledge of the legal aspects of the issue , I came to the conclusion that , when in doubt , it was better to take the risk . 
we did take that risk , and it resulted in the Supreme Court of Canada making a landmark ruling on the doctrine of necessity . 
the court concluded that all the Manitoba acts passed since 1898 were unconstitutional and did not comply with the provisions governing the status of Manitoba when it joined Confederation , in 1870 . 
however , in its wisdom , the Supreme Court was of the opinion that the application of its judgment had to be stayed until a solution was found to translate the huge number of statutes , laws and regulations that had been adopted in Manitoba since 1898 . 
you know what happened next . 
with the support of the Canadian government , and I must add , honourable senators , thanks to the Government of Manitoba and its then premier , Mr. Pawley , we were able to meet the requirements of the Supreme Court judgement . 
when I first came into this chamber and met Mrs. Forest , however , I told her she was part of an important heritage , one that had changed our country . 
it is only fitting that we , in return , have the opportunity today to pay tribute to her and her family . 
hon. Marcel Prud ' homme : 
honourable senators , I have had the pleasure of coming to know Senator Forest in the Senate . 
i have had two occasions to see what this person coming to us from Alberta was made of . 
the first time , we were debating the amendment to Clause 17 of the Constitution . 
you will recall how eloquently she defended minority rights . 
i continue to believe - although as a democrat , I bowed to the will of the majority - that she was right , that the minority voice in the Senate was right . 
she had foreseen this . 
i listened to her well . 
now look at what has happened since the weekend . 
we had been promised religion courses in Quebec schools , despite the constitutional changes . 
we will be found to be right far sooner than expected . 
already the CEQ is carrying out a huge campaign across Quebec , not only on linguistic matters , but also to abolish any kind of religion . 
you will soon see that Senator Dalia Wood may have been right about abolishing the minority language in Quebec . 
we will leave it up to history to judge , but so far I believe she was right . 
she showed great independence of mind , politically . 
everyone listened to Senator Forest attentively . 
when I fell ill , the first long letter I got from anyone was from her , making certain highly appropriate recommendations as to care , and speaking of her family history . 
i followed her suggestions to the letter . 
honourable senators , I wish to thank Senator Forest for all her kindness to me during her time in the Senate . 
having sat with her in this chamber , for all too brief a period , I am well aware of her abilities as a senator , and I know what she could have achieved had she stayed with us . 
she is truly an example to follow . 
i would suggest to senators appointed after her that they go back and read what she said during the debate on the education question in Quebec and Newfoundland . 
i wish all the best to Senator Forest . 
i hope that if the opportunity presents itself she will visit us often so that we may benefit from her good advice , because senators need good advice to remain neutral and independent . 
this she has given to the Senate and to all senators in her very brief stay with us . 
hon. Ron Ghitter : 
honourable senators , I , too , wish to pay my respects and tributes to Jean Forest , and also to her husband , Rocky . 
i have known this wonderful lady since the early 1970 s . 
she is a woman of civility and dignity - and , I might add , of a certain amount of secrecy . 
for instance , until she was appointed to the Senate , I did not even know she was a Liberal . 
pleased as I was to see her here , I was not aware of her political leanings . 
in Alberta , that is somewhat unusual . 
Alberta is not an easy place in which to be an avid supporter of human rights . 
indeed , Jean Forest is an individual who has stood up and been in the forefront in many different ways in support of minority groups in our community who do not have spokespersons . 
she has always been an eloquent spokesperson for the underprivileged , for those in need of education and for those deprived of their human rights . 
indeed , recently she sent a letter to the editor in my defence in the human rights area , which I very much appreciated . 
honourable senators , I was saddened , as I know were all members of the Senate , to hear that Jean was leaving us , understanding full well the reasons . 
she has always placed her family first and Rocky first . 
i am not surprised by how respected Senator Forest is in the Senate , because I have known her for years . 
those of you who have met her just recently have already come to respect and admire her , and I am sure you , too , are saddened by the fact that she is leaving . 
however , I know she will always be active in her community , and I know she will always be there when we need her . 
senator Forest , we very much wish you and Rocky well in all your future endeavours , and we wish you good health and continued good life in your community . 
hon. Roch Bolduc : 
honourable senators , I should like to say to Senator Forest that I am also a Rocky fan . 
i knew Senator Forest when she was on the Standing Senate Committee on National Finance . 
we could see that she had experience in public administration and she put it to good use on the committee .

Nova Scotia 
eighty - First Anniversary of Explosion in Halifax Harbour 
hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
honourable senators , I should like to say a few brief words , and to join my colleagues in paying tribute to the survivors , and to those killed by the Halifax explosion on December 6 , 1917 which is 81 years ago yesterday . 
honourable senators , on that black day , the Imo and the Mont Blanc collided in Halifax Harbour , igniting fires that set off the munitions on the Mont Blanc , and produced the greatest man - made explosion to that date . 
the north end of Halifax was levelled , and damage was suffered in Dartmouth . 
the explosion was heard in Prince Edward Island and the tidal wave that the explosion caused was felt many miles out to sea . 
honourable senators , for a population of 50,000 , the casualties were horrific . 
there were 1,600 people killed , 9,000 injured , 13,500 buildings destroyed and 6,000 people left homeless . 
worse for the survivors was the fact the explosion occurred in winter and many homeless suffered terribly from the fierce winter weather conditions . 
i wish to join with those who paid tribute to the dead or injured in the explosion . 
i also wish to draw attention to the lighting of the Christmas tree in Boston yesterday . 
this was done to salute , 81 years after the fact , the tremendous personal contribution and sacrifice that the people of Massachusetts and the other New England states made to help us in our time of great difficulty . 
they sent doctors , nurses , food and clothing . 
they did everything that was needed to be done and , more important , they did it as long as it had to be done . 
to the families of the victims of that explosion , including those among us in this chamber , our prayers go out to you all . 
united Nations 
fiftieth Anniversary of Declaration of Human Rights 
hon. Mabel M. DeWare : 
honourable senators , I rise with pleasure to speak about the 50 th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that Canada and the world will celebrate on Thursday , December 10 . 
this anniversary will be a glorious celebration of life and liberty . 
the declaration recognizes that we all , no matter who we are , have certain rights simply because we are human beings . 
more important , it sets out to protect those rights . 
today I should like to draw the attention of this chamber to the political rights of women . 
i will start by pointing out that the political rights for women are the same as the political rights of men . 
women ' s rights are human rights . 
however , since women as a group have traditionally faced more discrimination , special attention must be paid to protect those rights . 
honourable senators , it is easy for us in Canada to take such rights for granted . 
after all , Canadian women can vote , run for election and hold any political office . 
i stand before you today as a female senator and an example of the political rights we enjoy . 
my many female colleagues in this chamber and in other places also bear witness to this great fortune . 
we must remember , however , that for much of Canada ' s history , women did not have any political rights at all . 
sadly , these rights remain a dream even today for women in too many countries . 
the political rights of both women and men are set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . 
the United Nations recognized that a separate agreement was needed to uphold the political rights of women in particular . 
therefore , in December 1952 , the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention of the Political Rights of Women which came into force in July 1954 . 
this agreement was the first instrument of international law aimed at recognizing and protecting the political rights of women everywhere . 
it provides that women , on an equal basis with men , are entitled to vote in any election , run for election to any office , hold any political office or exercise any political function under national law . 
we must look at the history of this agreement to fully appreciate why it was needed and how it came about . 
to do that we must go back to the early days of the UN . 
when the United Nations Charter was signed , the world was emerging from the horrors of the Second World War . 
in many countries , men and women had worked , fought and suffered together as equals . 
during the war effort , many barriers to women ' s participation in society fell and women glimpsed a world in which they could enjoy the same freedoms and status as men . 
as a result , the framers of the UN ' s founding document wove into it a vision of gender equality . 
honourable senators , the UN Convention on Political Rights of Women has helped to improve the political outlook of women considerably . 
however , we still have a long way to go . 
some countries continue to deny women their political rights . 
even in those that do not , women do not exercise these rights on a uniformly equal basis . 
today , the United Nations continues to develop civic and political education programs and other measures to encourage women to take an active part in life . 
i know my colleagues will join me in applauding those efforts as we celebrate the 50 th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . 
hon. Senators : 
hear , hear ! 
national Day of Remembrance 
action on Violence Against Women 
hon. Lucie P é pin : 
honourable senators , today , once again , we join with people across Canada who yesterday marked the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women . 
it is with great sadness that we recall the terrible events that culminated in the tragic murder of 14 young women nine years ago at the É cole polytechnique in Montreal . 
December 6 has become more than a mere commemoration of the deaths of these women , who were struck down in their prime . 
it is a call to action and a reminder that we must all work together to end all acts of violence against women and children . 
research has confirmed what women and women ' s organizations have always known , that violence against women is both pervasive and pernicious . 
according to Statistics Canada , 51 per cent of all Canadian women have experienced at least one incident of physical or sexual violence since the age of 16 . 
women ' s organizations have been working tirelessly for many years to make the public aware of the problem of violence against women and children . 
one of the things they have come up with is the Clothesline Project , a display of T - shirts decorated by artists who have survived an assault , a rape or incest . 
the project sends a clear message that violence touches every community , and has enormous social and economic consequences for Canada . 
the Clothesline Project helps to ensure that violence is no longer a shameful secret shared by women as they swap stories over the backyard clothesline . 
the dirty laundry one did not air in polite conversation is now fully out in the open . 
just as the shirts hang shoulder to shoulder , so too must the women and men of this country work shoulder to shoulder as we strive to change attitude and actions . 
eliminating violence against women will require the efforts of all sectors of society - government , business , voluntary organizations and individual women and men - in order to bring about meaningful and lasting change . 
i urge all members of this chamber to help make society a safer place by supporting anti - violence work in our communities . 
the women and children of Canada are counting on us . 
Anglo - American Relations 
anniversary of Signing of Atlantic Charter in Newfoundland 
hon. Ethel Cochrane : 
honourable senators , as you have just heard from Senator DeWare , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 10 , 1948 . 
prior to the meeting , observers feared that the two would never find common philosophical ground , given their vastly different characters and independence of thinking . 
on August 14 , 1941 , the two leaders met , would you believe , off the coast of Newfoundland ? 
they agreed that all peoples should have the right to choose their own government , borders should not be imposed by force , international economic cooperation was necessary and use of force in international relations should end . 
meeting in London on September 24 , 1941 , 10 other countries at war with the Axis Powers declared their support for the charter . 
by 1942 , 26 countries had declared their support . 
it was their cooperation that later led to the creation of the United Nations organization . 
we should note , honourable senators , that the great principles of self - government , autonomy and freedom from persecution cemented the Allied forces ' resolve to fight a common adversary . 
this cooperation , based on principle , clearly demonstrated that individual differences can be put aside when working toward a common goal . 
it is in the spirit of cooperation and fraternity that the Second World War was won . 
the Atlantic Charter , however , speaks a language far more important than that of mere cooperation between state leaders . 
the Atlantic Charter is historically significant because it is one of the first cross - border cooperatives based on morality and principle , and it established fundamental principles upon which the United Nations organization was built .

( a ) the Senate , by its own order of October 28 , 1997 , ordered the constitution of the Special Joint Committee on Child Custody and Access , which was again ordered on November 19 th last to report to the Senate by December 11 , 1998 ; 
( b ) the Senate has not yet taken cognizance or possession of this Committee ' s Report , which , still in confidential draft form , the Senate is presently awaiting its introduction in the Senate ; 
( c ) this Committee ' s draft Report has not even been seen by Senators , including the Senate ' s Leaders , save those 7 Senators who are members of this Special Joint Committee ; 
( d ) this draft Report has fallen improperly , and without Senate authorization , into the possession of certain persons who include one Carole Curtis , a lawyer , a member of the Law Society of Upper Canada and a Bencher of that Society , as evidenced in her interviews with Jeremy Torobin in the London Free Press , November 28 th 1998 and the Toronto Sun , November 29 th , 1998 , which quoted her very own words : " The leaked draft report that I saw .... " ; 
( e ) Carole Curtis , being an Officer of the Court and also a Bencher , owes a duty and an obligation to this Court , the High Court of Parliament , to honour , uphold , and observe the Lex Parliamenti , the Law of Parliament , in respect of Parliament ' s entitlement to its own reports and its own proceedings ; and 
( f ) the law societies and officers of the court of this land have a duty and obligation to Parliament in respect of Parliament ' s entitlement to its own reports and its own proceedings ; 
that the Senate of Canada disapproves of Officer of the Court Carole Curtis ' improper possession and unauthorized usage of Parliament ' s own report , leaked while yet unseen by the Senate , before it was even received by the Senate ; and by Parliament , the Highest Court in the land .

solicitor General 
resignation of Chairman of Commission of Inquiry into Treatment of Protestors at APEC Conference by RCMP - Proposal for Separate Judicial Inquiry - Government Position 
hon. No ë l A . Kinsella ( Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , incredibly , the saga of the forces of darkness continues . 
incredibly , on Friday , a second fall has occurred , namely the resignation of the APEC panel of the RCMP Public Complaints Commission . 
one wonders how many more falls or fall guys there will be before the government realizes that this thing is so cancerous that the only way that justice and truth will be ascertained is through a judicial inquiry under the Inquiries Act . 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
as I said previously , the government is already operating with the authority of the Public Complaints Commission that was established by the previous government . 
that independent mechanism for hearing complaints made by the public against the RCMP is in operation . 
it certainly has had its difficulties , and I think everyone in the country would acknowledge that . 
however , the government continues to have confidence in the system as it was established , and that is the road we will be taking . 
the government will follow the recommendations of the commission and its chair . 
even if the government wanted to stop the inquiry , it does not have the authority to do so . 
senator Kinsella : 
honourable senators , if the government intends to continue to rely on the RCMP Public Complaints Commission as the mechanism for effective civilian oversight of the RCMP , what do they say about the interference with the APEC panel by the Chair of the RCMP Public Complaints Commission itself , Shirley Heafey ? 
as Mr. Morin has said , Ms Heafey wrote to him , instructing him to read a letter into the record , which instruction was ultimately refused by Mr. Morin . 
is that not interference with the panel by the Chair of the RCMP Complaints Commission itself ? 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , it would be inappropriate for me to comment on unsubstantiated allegations reported in the media regarding the actions of the chairperson of the commission . 
involvement of Prime Minister ' s Staff in Security Arrangements at APEC Conference 
hon. No ë l A . Kinsella ( Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
this agreement was confirmed by the RCMP on November 11 , 1997 . 
then , honourable senators , on November 13 , 1997 , a PMO advance team visiting the campus reduced the line - of - sight area considerably . 
does the Leader of the Government not see this as prima facie evidence of PMO conduct which could only be accounted for by an inquiry either under the Inquiries Act or by a parliamentary inquiry ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
no , I would come to the opposite conclusion . 
as I indicated on earlier occasions , the Chief of Staff , Mr. Pelletier , and the former director of operations of the Prime Minister ' s Office , Mr. Carle , have both volunteered to testify before the Public Complaints Commission . 
the chairperson of the Public Complaints Commission has indicated that it has the capacity to carry on . 
again , I would ask that the commission be allowed to do its work and hear the witnesses . 
commission of Inquiry into Treatment of Protestors at APEC Conference by RCMP - Request to Table Complete Documents Received from British Columbia Civil Liberties Association 
hon. David Tkachuk : 
i have a supplementary . 
senator Berntson : 
he did not get to the good parts . 
senator Tkachuk : - many objections from this side as to what he was trying to get at . 
however , in that letter , it says : 
as the attached documents show , there is also strong prima facie evidence to think that the PMO is not a neutral party in these proceedings . 
perhaps the Leader of the Government would explain why he did not table those documents ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
i read from the letter , but I did not read from the documents . 
however , I volunteered to table the letter , and I would be very happy to table the documents . 
senator Tkachuk , I will either table the document , which is quite thick - 
senator Kinsella : 
agreed . 
senator Berntson : 
that is okay . 
senator Graham : - or I can make copies available to those who are interested . 
it is my understanding that the documents are available through the Public Complaints Commission . 
i am in the hands of honourable senators . 
i do not have the documents with me at the present time , but I am sure I can get a copy or copies of those documents to which I referred . 
i believe Senator Kinsella probably has that material on his desk . 
he can wave it around . 
to make it official , I would be very happy to bring in the copy of the documentation that was sent to me and officially table it , if that is the wish of honourable senators . 
senator Tkachuk : 
that would be fine with me . 
could you give me an idea of when those documents would be tabled ? 
senator Graham : 
i suppose it would be too unofficial for me to ask Senator Kinsella to lend me his copy , to have it tabled . 
i will ensure that my copy of those documents is tabled in the chamber no later than tomorrow . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
is leave granted for the tabling of the documents ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
resignation of Chairman of Commission of Inquiry into Treatment of Protestors at APEC Conference by RCMP - Efficacy of Remaining Panel - Allegations Against Chair of RCMP Public Complaints Commission - Government Position 
hon. Donald H . Oliver : 
my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate . 
in light of Gerald Morin ' s resignation as Chair of the APEC inquiry committee panel , it is clear that the commission is incapable of doing the work that it was supposed to do . 
will the commission carry on its work with only two panel members , or will a third panel member be added to the hearing process , and then have it restarted ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
that is an interesting question . 
i read in the press that the chair of the commission said that they could carry on with two members . 
being an independent body , it would be up to the commission itself , on the recommendation of the chair , the vice - chair , and other authoritative people on the commission , to make that determination . 
the government cannot direct the commission in its work , but my understanding , from reading the press , is that the chair said that the commission could continue with two commissioners . 
senator Oliver : 
if that is the case , does the Leader of the Government have any information as to when they might resume ? 
senator Graham : 
my understanding is that they want to wait to hear what decisions may be rendered by the Federal Court . 
senator Oliver : 
honourable senators , how does the government respond to calls by Kevin Woodall , the lawyer for the 39 mounties involved in the APEC hearings , that RCMP Public Complaints Commission chairman Shirley Heafey should resign over allegations of impropriety regarding the resignation of APEC chair Gerald Morin ? 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , I have already replied to that kind of question that I believe it is inappropriate for me to comment on what I would judge to be unsubstantiated allegations reported in the media . 
national Defence 
failure to Use Sea King Helicopter in Search and Rescue Mission - Government Position 
hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
honourable senators , I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate . 
about now , HMCS Halifax is pulling into port in St. John ' s , Newfoundland . 
on board is a very seriously injured seaman off the Japanese Habomai Maru 88 . 
yesterday , the HMCS Halifax raced to the scene of the accident about 350 miles off Newfoundland for the purpose of carrying out a medical evacuation . 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
regrettably , I must report , in the event that honourable senators have not already heard , that a single - engine commuter aircraft with 10 people on board , on a flight between Baie Comeau and Rimouski , has crashed . 
we only received word of the incident early this afternoon . 
the last news report was that seven people were still missing and three have been found . 
there is a Coast Guard vessel on the scene . 
a Labrador helicopter out of Trenton and a Hercules aircraft have also been dispatched to the scene . 
it is hoped that all of the missing people will be found alive . 
senator Forrestall : 
we will all pray for that . 
i will answer the question for the minister . 
yes , this is a serious matter . 
until the end of November , HMCS Halifax had on board a Sea King helicopter . 
it was taken off because it was not a priority mission to be patrolling the North Atlantic in the wintertime . 
that is because the Sea King crews are , of course , stretched to the limit . 
they are already tasked to do search and rescue work on both the East Coast and the West Coast . 
we all know that they are available less than 50 per cent of the time . 
the Labradors at Greenwood are still not up and flying . 
until November , HMCS Halifax had a helicopter . 
however , it was not considered a priority , and the helicopters are deployed only on a priority basis , because the Sea Kings , as is the case with the Labradors , are available only about 50 per cent of the time due to the extensive maintenance required for each hour of flying time . 
search and rescue in Atlantic Canada is hanging by a very tenuous thread . 
should something happen to any of the thousands of lobster fishermen working in the North Atlantic , we will have let them down . 
we will not be seen to be even making an effort to provide the search and rescue to which they are entitled . 
when will the government admit its mistakes in this area and initiate at least the maritime helicopter program ? 
senator Graham : 
as I indicated earlier , honourable senators , we are indeed fortunate that HMCS Halifax was in the neighbourhood . 
i will try to get an accurate answer , further to my honourable friend ' s information , on why there was not a Sea King helicopter on board that ship . 
i would assure him that the procurement strategy to replace the ageing Sea Kings is currently under discussion . 
senator Forrestall : 
honourable senators , would the minister to be kind enough to recommend to the full cabinet that , until we resolve the crisis in search and rescue , there be no vessel from which a Sea King can operate out in those waters without one on board ? 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , I will certainly bring the representation of Senator Forrestall to the attention of my colleagues . 
as I said the other day , the final judgment has to be made by the Minister of National Defence , but he certainly does take the advice of the Chief of the Defence Staff and all those who serve under him . 
replacement of Labrador Helicopters on Search and Rescue Missions - Update on Decision on Leasing Alternative Aircraft - Government Position 
hon. Gerry St. Germain : 
honourable senators , my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate . 
has a decision been made , or is one imminent , with regard to leasing helicopters ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
that is a good question but I do not know the answer . 
i will bring forward the answer as soon as it becomes available . 
Cape Breton Development Corporation 
possible Negotiations on Sale of Corporation - Role of Parliament in Decision - Making Process - Government Position 
hon. Lowell Murray : 
honourable senators , can the Leader of the Government tell us whether it is true that the Cape Breton Development Corporation is up for sale ? 
if so , under what authority has the government put it up for sale ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , to my knowledge , the Cape Breton Development Corporation is not up for sale . 
however , that does not exclude the possibility of Devco being on the market at some time in the future . 
i wish to assure my honourable friend that there are ongoing discussions among my cabinet colleagues , the Board of Directors of Devco , all the stakeholders , and the Premier of Nova Scotia , who happens to be in Ottawa , as my honourable friend would know . 
senator Murray : 
honourable senators , spokesmen for the government , who are still anonymous , have told the media in Nova Scotia that negotiations are proceeding with two different prospective buyers for the Cape Breton Development Corporation . 
is this true ? 
senator Graham : 
as I promised my honourable friend , before we adjourn for the Christmas break I intend to bring forward as complete a statement as I possibly can . 
senator Murray : 
honourable senators , I appreciate that . 
i need not remind the minister , who is as close as anyone in the government to this Crown corporation , that Devco was set up by an act of Parliament and that surely Parliament should be consulted before any negotiations go forward to sell it . 
i must confess that I am astounded to hear that the minister does not know whether such negotiations are taking place . 
if such negotiations have been authorized , surely they have been authorized by cabinet . 
if he is telling me that no such negotiations have been authorized by cabinet , then we will leave it at that and I will chalk it up to inaccurate media reports . 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , I can assure my honourable friend that there are no ongoing negotiations of which I am aware at the present time . 
however , there is certainly a great deal of speculation out there . 
my honourable friend Senator Murray has demonstrated a great concern for the coal mining industry , I am sure not only because he was born and raised in New Waterford , which is one of the centres of the coal mining industry in this country , but also because he is very familiar and very concerned with the situation . 
as I said , before we adjourn , I shall bring forward as complete a statement as I possibly can . 
on the subject of the approval of the negotiations for the sale of Devco , I am certainly not aware of them . 
i am quite conscious of the fact that such a sale would require an act of Parliament . 
senator Murray : 
surely my friend agrees that it would require authorization by the cabinet before anyone on the government ' s behalf could enter into discussions with prospective buyers for this wholly - owned Crown corporation . 
my friend agrees with that proposition , I presume ? 
senator Graham : 
yes , I certainly do . 
possible Negotiations on Sale of Corporation - Requirement of Agreement of Nova Scotia Government on Sale - Government Position 
hon. John Buchanan : 
honourable senators , I have a supplementary question . 
i know the Leader of the Government in the Senate is aware that before there can be any sale of Devco , a transfer of licences and the specific consent of the Government of Nova Scotia must be obtained . 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
yes , that is my understanding , Senator Buchanan . 
there will be , of course , an ongoing debate as to who is the owner of the resource , which is the coal . 
whether that argument would hold any weight is left to those with a better legal mind than my own . 
however , I am quite conscious of the point that is being put forward by Senator Buchanan . 
senator Buchanan : 
honourable senators , I ask the minister if he is aware that the matter of under - seabed resources was settled , as far as oil and gas is concerned , by a tremendous , wonderful , well - researched agreement signed in 1982 by the then premier of Nova Scotia and the Prime Minister of Canada , Mr. Trudeau . 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , indeed I recall , and I congratulate the former premier of Nova Scotia who helped bring that agreement forward . 
i remember some of the great debates that were held in this chamber , in which the late G . I. Smith took part , with respect to the ownership of those valuable offshore resources . 
to return to the question that was raised by Senator Murray , I can assure all honourable senators that no authority has been given to any individual , group of individuals or body to pursue , in the process of negotiations , the sale of a mine or coal mines in Cape Breton . 
orders OF THE DAY 
national Parks Act 
bill to Amend - Third Reading - Debate Continued 
on the Order : 
resuming debate on the motion of the Honourable Senator Butts , seconded by the Honourable Senator Milne , for the third reading of Bill C - 38 , to amend the National Parks Act ( creation of Tuktut Nogait National Park ) . 
hon. Willie Adams : 
honourable senators , I would congratulate Senator Butts who moved third reading of this bill . 
we in the Energy Committee have been studying the bill for the last couple of months . 
as many of you know , I have deep concerns about Bill C - 38 . 
my main concern is with the position taken by the government . 
section 22.1 of the Tuktut Nogait agreement signed in 1996 states : 
any party may request a review by the parties of part or all of this agreement . 
if all the parties agree , they shall initiate the review within ninety ( 90 ) days of the request . 
in 1996 , when the agreement was signed between the Inuvialuit and Parks Canada , there was evidence of some mineral deposits in the park . 
in 1997 , some mining companies decided to do more exploration early in the summer , and these readings , done with advanced equipment , found new potential for mineral development in the proposed park area . 
seven spots have been identified : six outside the boundary of the park and one within . 
according to our witnesses from the Inuvialuit and everyone in the community with whom I have spoken , the signed agreement is very important . 
the economic future of the people living in the area is also very important . 
Tuktut Nogait National Park covers an area of 16,340 square kilometres . 
another 11,660 square kilometres were given to the park by the Sahtu and Nunavut . 
the park would then cover an area of 28,000 square kilometres . 
the boundary adjustment as proposed by Bill C - 38 is only 2.5 per cent of the park . 
according to the mining company , they have 80 per cent of the area for future mining . 
we heard from mining prospectors that that is not out of line . 
the only thing they are concerned about is the ore , but those people did not have an agreement on their lands before . 
now the Inuvialuit would like access . 
however , Parks Canada is saying , " Sorry , you already signed the agreement . 
nothing changes . " 
we did our best on the committee to ensure that Parks Canada would have a change of mind on the boundary . 
i am talking about the calving area between Tuktut Nogait National Park and the Inuvialuit area . 
this area comprises 16,340 square kilometres . 
the Sahtu and the Nunavut gave 11,660 square kilometres to the park . 
the calving area for the Bluenose caribou in Tuktut is 28,000 square kilometres , yet we cannot get 2.5 per cent of the land back to secure our future . 
we asked Darnley Bay Resources about this . 
they showed us slides of the area . 
the ore comes up like five or six fingers from 1,000 feet down in the ground . 
the Inuvialuit settled their land claims with the Government of Canada . 
since the land claims were settled , they have given away 29 per cent of the protected areas . 
between the Inuvialuit land and the Yukon border , we have park lands put aside already . 
it is hard for the Inuvialuit , who wish to get that little piece of land back , but the government says " no . " 
bill C - 38 is concerned about the lands of the Inuvialuit and has nothing to do with the rest of Canada . 
the other park land is the north slope between Alaska and the Yukon . 
the Porcupine caribou have migrated to that area for years . 
in the summertime , caribou usually take a route along the shore . 
we know that we do not have to hunt on the mainland , because we can hunt along the shore . 
we do not have to walk any more to hunt for caribou , because in the summer there are so many caribou . 
i have seen farmers put salt out so that their cows can lick the salt . 
the caribou are no different ; they need salt too . 
in the summertime , they eat sea salt because it is good for their digestive systems . 
i am concerned about the people who live in the Paulatuk area ; I am concerned about their community and the future of their economy . 
an magazine article I read said that in this area children aged 12 to 14 are already beginning to have babies . 
what will happen between now and 10 years ' time if we do not provide jobs for these communities ? 
i am concerned about the Inuvialuit economy . 
those young people will not have any jobs . 
by the time they are 22 years old , their children will be 10 . Some who are going to school are having babies , and they must drop out of school . 
they will also be meeting early in the new year , because the people who live up there are concerned about the future and what they will do . 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans visited Iqaluit a month ago . 
he had an agreement with the people of Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. with respect to the future of the sea mammals . 
sometimes we have quotas for the mammals , especially the narwhals , the belugas and some of the other fish that we have up there . 
there is a quota for the Arctic char for its commercial use . 
it is important for those people to have the development of the caribou . 
it is typical for us to impose decisions upon those people who have lived up there for many years . 
nothing is ever said to them . 
in 1999 , Nunavut will be self - governed . 
i wish to give you some history about what is happening to the government in the North . 
in 1950 , the Government of Canada stepped in to give us an education and welfare system . 
that was about 48 years ago . 
the Government of the Northwest Territories decided to start moving towards self - government in 1966 . 
that was 32 years ago . 
the Inuvialuit settled land claims with the Government of Canada in 1984 . 
that is about 14 years ago . 
because of her , every year , the inhabitants living under the agreement between the Government of Canada and the Inuvialuit receive a dividend . 
in Nunavut , ITC started negotiations with the Government of Canada to settle the land claims . 
before an agreement was reached with NTI , they took over from ITC . 
it took us 25 years to reach an agreement with the Government of Canada . 
in February 1999 , we will have an election . 
we will elect an assembly with 19 members . 
the legislature will be opened after the celebrations on April 1 , 1999 . Prime Minister Chr é tien will be there to help us celebrate on April 1 , 1999 . 
that piece of property that the Inuvialuit are concerned about is important to them . 
the Inuvialuit are concerned about their future if mining were to proceed . 
Falconbridge is looking , with concern , at how we have lagged behind . 
right now , nothing has been done . 
there has been no exploration or anything and we do not know how big the deposit of ore is that is contained within the park boundary . 
now that the bill is passed , it is not a big deal . 
the NTI and the Sahtu own part of the park , but they do not even have their signatures on an agreement . 
between the two of them , they will have given away 11,000 square kilometres of land . 
honourable senators , I am still concerned . 
without killing the bill , we can do something . 
after seven years of negotiations and $ 10 million , some buildings have been constructed in Tuktut Nogait park , but I do not think you will even see two people hired to work in that national park . 
the government regulations stipulate that you must have a grade 12 education . 
at committee I heard that there is not much in the future for people to visit the park because most of the time the caribou will not be there in the spring because of the weather and many other factors . 
if over a half million caribou were to go over the same area of land , much of that land would be destroyed . 
the caribou do not migrate together . 
the only time they migrate together is when they get cold , so they begin to travel further south before they go back up north . 
that is what I have seen during my life living in the North . 
those people who proposed this park cannot see that . 
honourable senators , I believe we should have another look at this bill . 
we should finish in the Aboriginal Peoples Committee what was begun in the Energy Committee . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
on motion of Senator Carstairs , debate adjourned . 
the Estimates , 1998 - 99 
report of National Finance Committee on Supplementary Estimates ( B ) Adopted 
the Senate proceeded to consideration of the sixth report of the Standing Senate Committee on National Finance ( Supplementary Estimates ( B ) 1998 - 99 ) presented in the Senate on December 3 , 1998 . 
honourable senators , I should like to speak briefly to this report . 
first , I should like to thank some members of the bureaucracy , whom we rarely ever thank . 
in this case it is appropriate , because two new people from Treasury Board appeared before us . 
i have been around long enough now to recognize when people are being cooperative and not cooperative . 
these two individuals , especially Mr. Neville , came before us and answered our questions . 
they are cooperative , bright , friendly and superbly well informed . 
they know their documents very well . 
i should like to pay particular thanks to him . 
to go on to the contents of the report itself , total planned spending is now expected to come in at about $ 152.1 billion , which is $ 6.6 billion more than the original amount listed in the Main Estimates last spring . 
it also represents a $ 5.3 - billion increase over the figure provided in the Supplementary Estimates ( A ) . 
my concern is that it is $ 6.6 billion above the original Estimates tabled last spring . 
i should like to issue that warning . 
although we are not even at the end of this year yet , I should like particularly to bring your attention to that . 
the committee also raised questions regarding the $ 625.9 million requested to assist the Bank of Thailand . 
is this open - ended or is there a limit on how much Canada contributes ? 
under the Bretton Woods Agreement , there are limits to Canada ' s obligations to provide assistance . 
canada is limited to a maximum of $ 2.5 billion U.S. in respect of any particular foreign state , and $ 5 billion U.S. in respect of all foreign states . 
therefore , our obligations are limited . 
we are also concerned about the costs of the Swissair crash investigation . 
this is set out in the Chicago Convention on Civil Aviation . 
however , Mr. Neville informed the committee that the safety board is attempting to recoup some of the costs from the airline . 
the U.S. , as honourable senators will recall , sent a large salvage vessel , and they are not expected to send Canada a bill for that . 
we are also concerned with the amount of money being spent on disaster relief . 
as honourable senators may know , it has been a bugaboo of mine that we react well to disasters but that we do not do long - range planning well to minimize the impact on Canadians , both in terms of dollars and in terms of the impact on their lives . 
you could take that $ 1.4 billion and feel relatively comfortable in doubling it . 
disasters have a significant impact economically on this country . 
we cannot simply sit back and do nothing about that . 
honourable senators , I wish to talk a bit about theY 2 K problem , which is coming at us one year from today . 
that buys a lot of independent consultants ' time . 
there are a great number of them . 
how do we control that ? 
how do we ensure that these systems are secure ? 
the consultants must be screened , but there is absolutely no control over the fact that , if someone wants to build a back door into our systems , there is nothing to prevent that . 
we still have concerns about the integrity of our systems and about their interrelationships . 
further , we should be concerned not only about the interrelationships of our systems , but about the relationships of our systems with private systems and with international systems . 
not enough attention is being paid to that issue . 
i do not want to make this an emotional issue , but we must be realistically concerned about what is coming down the track at us . 
i would close with that statement . 
i know that we are running late and I will say no more except to mention the costs of the APEC inquiry . 
the clock is running and it is costing money . 
i hope that will not continue for too long . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , the clock now says six o ' clock , and under the rules I must leave the Chair and return at eight o ' clock unless I have an indication that it is the wish of honourable senators for me not to see the clock . 
hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
there is agreement not to see the clock . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
is it agreed , honourable senators ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
i will not see the clock , then . 
hon. Roch Bolduc : 
for the first time in quite a while , the government ' s estimates have gone up , from $ 148 billion to $ 152 billion . 
that is new . 
normally we have a framework of expenses . 
we have the main estimates first , and then the supplementary estimates . 
in general , this is all part of what the government forecast in the budget speech . 
on the one hand , the programs to be adopted will go up from $ 42 billion to $ 46 billion . 
the budget program expenditures will go up $ 3 billion . 
on the other hand , there are the statutory expenditures . 
that is what the appropriations are used for . 
at year end , demographic or other adjustments are made . 
you have the non - budgetary expenditures , or in other words the government ' s commitments that are worth $ 500 million . 
as you know , Thailand was the first country to be hit by the Asian crisis . 
that depends who is going to pay , the people of Thailand , the borrowers or the banks ? 
i have said it is the Bank of Thailand . 
since then , things have gone badly in Indonesia , in the Philippines , in Korea , so we have not yet seen the end of it . 
fortunately , we have a maximum commitment of $ 2.5 billion , and $ 500 million of that has already been used . 
there is $ 2 billion left . 
i presume that , in the Supplementary Estimates ( C ) scheduled for mid - March , there ought to be another $ 500 million earmarked for one of these banks , probably the bank of Indonesia or Korea . 
this shows the systemic effects of international finance , of public and private funding . 
legislative expenditures represent nearly $ 1.5 billion . 
this is a fairly significant proportion of the $ 104 billion in statutory expenditures . 
you know that 70 per cent of Canada ' s budget is on automatic pilot . 
i laugh , but I should be crying . 
it is sad to think that 70 per cent of Canada ' s budget goes to statutory expenditures . 
in this case , there is some $ 500 million or $ 600 million for equalization payments and another $ 500 million for social transfers where demographic forecasts may have been wrong and adjustments are required . 
that is understandable , it is within the limits of common sense . 
as concerns the budgetary expenditure programs passed by the Commons , we see an 7.5 per cent increase in the estimates . 
that is a lot . 
that means that the government is beginning to feel a lot of pressure to spend money . 
i warn the Minister of Finance and the government , because this is just the beginning . 
what is coming along will be even stronger . 
of this $ 3 billion , the spending on fishers makes good sense . 
they were hit hard in the Maritimes and even in Quebec . 
a $ 300 million fund has been set up at Fisheries and Oceans , and another $ 300 million fund has been set up at Human Resources Development . 
that makes $ 600 million . 
i understand that the farmers will need help in the short term . 
it will be the next round , probably at the end of March or in the main estimates . 
the explanations on how this money is to be spent are not satisfactory . 
for the fishers , the resource is not there . 
are they going to buy the quotas of those who have money or of those who do not ? 
i have talked with Senator Robichaud and Senator Comeau , who are very familiar with these issues . 
the situation is difficult . 
i will not argue with the government on that point . 
what is needed is vision and a sense of direction . 
there is no point financing big ships and then saying there are no fish . 
the present government is not the only one to have done this . 
other governments took similar action , I know . 
successive governments tackle the problems , but the problems remain . 
setting aside resource spending , I am struck by something else . 
the more joint government programs there are , and the more often two or three departments are involved , the higher costs go . 
the Minister of Human Resources Development has intervened . 
the solutions being proposed are incomprehensible to the average person . 
in one way , that is unfortunate . 
even though the solutions included in the estimates are stated as clearly as possible , it is not easy for everyone , not even for us , to understand . 
another $ 500 million has been set aside for deferred expenses . 
i do not wish to discuss this . 
for the first $ 1 billion , it is a lot of money , but I will say no more . 
another $ 300 million has been set aside for the Year 2000 bug . 
in any event , I will not be flying on that day . 
there is some doubt about the following year . 
this was to be expected . 
four or five years ago , people bought computers . 
no provision was made in the software . 
however that may be , the situation is becoming urgent . 
there is $ 200 million set aside for collective agreements . 
the government has not given public servants a pay increase for a long time . 
this year , it is loosening the purse strings slightly because it has a bit more money available . 
as usual , this money is being used to pay the bills . 
i have been there . 
it is not easy to say in advance how much will be spent where . 
i am concerned about other expenses . 
next year , the Standing Committee on National Finance intends to study a plan for increasingly frequent emergencies having to do with weather , floods , and so on . 
on more sensitive issues , the departments of industry and of health are spending $ 100 million and $ 60 million respectively and are asking for more for new programs . 
these are the very departments who were told by the Auditor General in his last annual report that their programs were not very well run . 
i do not have the Auditor General ' s report with me , but he is not pleased with that . 
the minister will get more money for initiatives relating to elementary and secondary education . 
it seems to me the federal government is getting involved in these areas because it feels it has money these days . 
it draws $ 100 million or $ 60 million for various priorities in the health sector . 
i know there are priorities in health , but it is up to the provinces to define them . 
why is the federal government getting involved in this again ? 
it is not the first time I bring this up . 
i know that I am perceived as the old reasonable nationalist , but I am asking the government to be a little more receptive and to not do this on purpose because , at some point , the winning conditions will be there . 
i would ask the government to be cautious , because this type of expenditures creates problems . 
we will of course approve the Supplementary Estimates , but I think we are headed for trouble when we act like this . 
we must be cautious , and the Minister of Finance should be extremely careful . 
his position is not as sound as some may think . 
some people say there is a lot of money and the government does not know what to do with it . 
there is indeed a lot of money coming in these days , but we have to be careful . 
we may have to give half a billion or a billion dollars to the banks , to alleviate the problems generated by the crisis in Southeast Asia . 
farmers are also after the government . 
do not think for one second that it will not cost a lot of money . 
as you can see , there are costs ahead . 
the government must be able to anticipate such expenditures during the year . 
it is very important for the government to be aware of this . 
all the ministers want to spend money . 
except for the Minister of Finance and the President of the Treasury Board , they always want to spend . 
so , I tell the Minister of Finance : 
for heaven ' s sake , try to resist all these pressures , because there is still a lot of work to do . 
let us not forget that Canada ' s debt to GNP ratio is 69 per cent . 
we lowered it from 72 per cent down to 69 per cent , which is quite something . 
the debt has to be paid off . 
we cannot just take $ 800 million and put it into innovation and , the next day , take another $ 2.5 billion and put that into scholarships . 
we are looking for trouble when we act like that . 
i am speaking to you as a 70 - year - old who has seen quite a few budgets in his days , especially over the past 50 years , and who prepared quite a few as well . 
it seems to me that governments should act sensibly because otherwise they are going to cause problems in Quebec and elsewhere . 
that is not good . 
i will address Canada ' s situation later , when we come back in February . 
a budget will be tabled . 
we will get down to business because there will be much to say about the budget . 
we hear the Minister of Finance saying that all is well . 
i can tell you that this is all very complicated . 
we must take a serious look at Canada ' s situation , if we want to survive and be successful . 
in Quebec , it is even worse . 
we must be realistic about this . 
there is nothing wrong with boasting about Canada every once in a while , but we must also face the economic reality . 
there is competition and there is a global marketplace . 
and legislation will not sweep away this cumbersome reality . 
everyone agrees that the Canadian tax system is too burdensome . 
individuals are paying 25 per cent more in taxes than they should . 
that is why foreign companies do not come here . 
foreign investments in Canada have dropped as a result . 
today is not the right time for a long speech on economic policy , but I will tell you that we are facing serious problems . 
we must do something about it . 
granted , something has been done about the deficit , but the government did not reduce the deficit simply by cutting expenditures . 
we must get to the heart of the matter . 
the next five years will be difficult . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , if no other senator wishes to speak , I will proceed with the motion . 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
motion agreed to and report adopted . 
tobacco Act 
bill to Amend - Second Reading - Debate Adjourned 
honourable senators , I wish to thank you for the opportunity to speak to this important piece of legislation . 
when it comes to matters of tobacco control , I think the collective will of this chamber has been amply demonstrated . 
certainly , we have been well ahead of the interests of the tobacco companies peddling their wares to adults and teens in this country . 
it is against this backdrop that we are today examining Bill C - 42 , to amend the Tobacco Act . 
it is because of our commitment to the cause of a smoke - free society that I encourage my honourable colleagues to support this legislation . 
honourable senators , permit me to take a few minutes to explain the purpose of Bill C - 42 . 
clearly , the immediate impact will not be to end smoking altogether because , while I would certainly consider such a goal desirable , it is hardly realistic at this time . 
the harsh reality is that almost one in three Canadians over the age of 15 - almost 7 million people in all - are smokers ; and , after a few years , they are hooked by the powerful , addictive nicotine in cigarettes . 
even though most smokers know the dangers of smoking , and in many cases have tried to quit , they simply cannot . 
if the challenge is so overwhelming , why do we even bother ? 
what difference can Bill C - 42 possibly make ? 
the answer , honourable senators , is that smoking is a public health menace that must be fought on many fronts . 
we need restaurants restricting their smoking sections just as much as we need teachers talking to youngsters about the hazards of smoking . 
we need all the provinces exploring every possible avenue to discourage tobacco consumption . 
within this major societal effort , the federal government has a key role to play . 
parliament has a wide variety of powers , from influencing the price of cigarettes through taxation policies , to requiring the disclosure of tobacco additives and emissions . 
bill C - 42 would add one more , the power to ban all tobacco sponsorship promotions of cultural and athletic events after the next five years . 
by 2003 , Canadians , and especially our impressionable young people , will no longer be forced to see the names of tobacco companies or cigarette brands when they go to a tennis match , a sailing regatta or when they attend a music festival . 
why is this important ? 
because all the evidence shows that cigarette marketing works . 
by associating cigarettes with popular events , be it car racing or concerts , tobacco companies are trying to glamourize their product . 
they have succeeded . 
today , nearly one in four teens aged 15 to 19 is taking up a habit that has a good chance of someday ruining his or her life . 
we all know that more than 40,000 Canadians die of smoking - related causes every year , and countless more suffer from emphysema and other debilitating illnesses . 
therefore , if we are serious about protecting the health of Canadians , we must do what we can to dissuade youngsters from starting to smoke . 
we must help them resist the powerful peer pressure that weighs so heavily upon them - pressure that is nourished and exploited by tobacco companies that advertise their products at popular events . 
i should like at this juncture to summarize the key aspects of the legislation . 
briefly , the amendments contained in Bill C - 42 would strengthen the Tobacco Act passed by the last Parliament . 
this legislation would put us squarely at the international forefront of tobacco control . 
other countries are developing similar bans , but we will have ours in place first , three years ahead of the European Union . 
bill C - 42 introduces a transitional process that would give existing events a two - year period without new sponsorship restrictions . 
during the following three years , off - site promotions would be confined to the lower 10 per cent of any signs , banners , billboards , or posters associated with the event in restricted locations . 
this transitional period would allow events organizers the time they need to find alternate sponsors . 
in five years , there would be no more promotions of tobacco sponsorship whatsoever . 
event names and facilities would no longer serve as none - too - subtle reminders of tobacco , and the law would apply even - handedly to all - busker festivals , hang - gliding championships , dance competitions , or air shows . 
honourable senators , I should like to draw your attention to a few more changes that were made to the bill as originally drafted during committee hearings in the other place . 
these amendments , as I understand it , sought to address the concerns of the health community which has been so active in helping Canada combat the tobacco menace . 
specifically , the first of these amendments would clarify that the five - year phase - in of the promotions ban actually began last October 1 . 
in other words , the clock is already ticking for tobacco companies . 
the other two amendments restrict the legislation ' s grandfathering provisions to events recently held and already promoted in Canada . 
the intent is to ensure that events cannot be moved to Canada from the United States or elsewhere and be treated during the law ' s phase - in period as though they have always been held here . 
similarly , it should not be permissible to resurrect long - abandoned events merely for their value as tobacco marketing vehicles . 
i mentioned a moment ago that Bill C - 42 would strengthen the Tobacco Act . 
that is true because there is no complete ban on those types of promotions under the existing act . 
all that is required under the current law is that cigarette companies adhere to the 90 - 10 rule which restricts their advertising space to the bottom 10 per cent of signs and billboards . 
the health community was not satisfied with that , nor should we be . 
if we believe in severing the noxious association between cigarettes and entertainment , then we must do it right . 
simply shrinking the brand names or moving them around on the billboard will not do the trick . 
we must be prepared to rid our nation of signs and symbols of smoking because they are a constant and unwelcome invitation to our young people . 
they are like a siren call , beckoning Canadians toward manifest danger . 
honourable senators , we in this chamber understand the importance of combating our single biggest public health threat with all the weapons at our disposal . 
bill C - 42 alone will not rid our society of smoking , but it would take us one more worthwhile step closer . 
i would urge my honourable colleagues to support this legislation . 
on motion of Senator Kinsella , for Senator Lavoie - Roux , debate adjourned . 
business of the Senate 
hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I think there is a willingness on both sides of the chamber to adjourn for the day , leaving every order on the Order Paper standing at the exact position that it is in this afternoon . 
for example , if a motion is at No. 15 today , it will remain at position No. 15 tomorrow . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
is it agreed , honourable senators ? 
hon. Marcel Prud ' homme : 
honourable senators , the deputy leader says " on both sides " of the house . 
i am willing to agree because I do not want to ruin the evening for some of my colleagues . 
am I to understand that tomorrow we will go through the Orders of the Day as they stand today ? 
will my colleagues who have an order on the Order Paper begin before Question Period ? 
senator Carstairs : 
we will deal with the Order Paper as we normally do . 
anything on the Order Paper today will remain in the position in which it is today , and anything that is slated to be added tomorrow will be added for tomorrow . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
is that agreed , honourable senators ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed .

Tuesday , December 8 , 1998 
the Senate met at 2:00 p.m. , the Speaker in the Chair . 
prayers . 
distinguished Visitor in Gallery 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , I should like to draw your attention to a distinguished visitor in our gallery , the former Honourable Senator Lorne Bonnell . 
hon. Senators : 
hear , hear ! 
senators ' STATEMENTS 
the Honourable Jean B . Forest 
tribute on Retirement 
hon. Joyce Fairbairn : 
honourable senators , yesterday senators made farewell tributes to Jean Forest , who resigned from the Senate last August . 
i was unable to join in as I was attending a Senate committee meeting at the time . 
i should like to offer my words to Jean today . 
first , it was wonderful that she was able to be up in the gallery to listen to all the fine words and the genuine affection expressed by colleagues on both sides of the chamber ; Liberals , Conservatives , independents , all of whom claimed her as a friend because she is that kind of person . 
she follows her principles wherever they lead her , even if it means from time to time disagreeing with the conclusions of the government . 
when she did disagree , it was in a clear and straightforward manner , with courtesy and conviction . 
jean is revered for her dedication to human rights , her fierce support for education at every level , her passionate love for every part of her country . 
these commitments were mirrored in her activities in the Senate , including her work on the Special Senate Committee on Post - Secondary Education , which travelled the country ; the hearings of the Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on the future of the War Museum ; her courage in following her convictions in the difficult issue of constitutional change in the school system of Newfoundland ; her deep concern for the well - being of aboriginal peoples and the strength of the francophone community outside Quebec . 
simply put , Jean Forest was a superb senator for her province of Alberta and her country , as demonstrated by her empathy for the concerns of citizens . 
in fact , if one tried to create an ideal senator , she would be a worthy model . 
she was with us for only a short time and she used every minute of that time . 
in the end , her family and her love and concern for the health of her husband and best friend , Rocky , claimed her full attention . 
they are happily building a new phase of their lives on Vancouver Island . 
i will miss her wisdom , her support and her laughter . 
in spite of the distance , I know our friendship will continue and I wish her and Rocky the best that life has to offer . 
amateur Sport 
prince Edward Island - Congratulations to Charlottetown Abbies for No. 1 National Ranking 
hon. Catherine S . Callbeck : 
honourable senators , there are very few things in this country that provide a greater bond than our national winter sport . 
who can forget Paul Henderson ' s heroics or the Gretzky - Lemieux combination working its magic in the competition for the Canada Cup . 
honourable senators , on - ice brilliance does not just happen . 
men and women of all age levels work long and hard , some almost from the time they take their first steps , to hone their skills so that they can eventually fulfil their dreams of representing their country internationally or perhaps carrying Lord Stanley ' s cup , as only the most elite are permitted . 
my home province is no stranger to success in the national and international hockey scene . 
i would suggest that on a per capita basis Prince Edward Island has placed more professional participants on the professional hockey stage than any other jurisdiction in the country . 
names like Doug MacLean , Gerard Gallant , Alan MacAdam , Errol Thompson , Bill and Bob MacMillan , and many more ring like a who ' s who in our nation ' s hockey lore . 
this week , the Charlottetown Abbies retained their number one ranking in the country . 
junior A hockey fans in Prince Edward Island could not be more proud . 
this is obviously quite an accomplishment . 
given the fact that less than two years ago Islanders were celebrating the Cinderella national championship victory of the Summerside Western Capitals , the reputation of Prince Edward Island ' s junior hockey appears to be solid indeed . 
general Manager Pat Gaudet also deserves to be recognized for his dedication to the team . 
however , the one person who I feel should be taking considerable pride in the accomplishments of his team this season is Abbie ' s owner , Alan Stewart . 
honourable senators , is that not what amateur sports in this country should be about , teamwork and working together to achieve a common goal ? 
if not for the Alan Stewarts and the Forbie Kennedys of this great country and their willingness to give whatever is necessary to make essential sacrifices to provide the proper environment for our young future stars , who knows where our national sport would be . 
i wish the Abbies all the best as they continue to hold their place in the national rankings . 
i am hopeful that they will be successful as the season moves towards its conclusion . 
some Hon. Senators : 
hear , hear ! 
human Rights 
anniversary of Signing of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
hon. David Tkachuk : 
honourable senators , I wish to address the subject of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . 
in the context of world history , this is just a short time ago . 
in 1960 , under John G . Diefenbaker , the Canadian government enshrined the basic principles of freedom and human rights in the Canadian Bill of Rights . 
when the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was open for signature on December 19 , 1966 , I was just married and 21 years of age . 
the country and the world that I grew up in was post World War II , an environment in which all Canadians sought to recognize the importance of never repeating the horrors and atrocities of that war . 
the lessons learned were terrible and horrifying , and those who were there vowed to never let happen again ; to our children , families , communities , country and global community . 
yet , we must always be wary because , while events such as those of the Second World War may not occur in that large a circumstance of human tragedy , they can and have happened again on a smaller scale in other countries of the world . 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights constitutes the first all - embracing and legally binding international treaty in the field of human rights . 
together with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international covenants , it forms the core of the International Bill of Human Rights . 
briefly defined , it affirms the right of all peoples to self - determination , traditional civil and political rights , some children ' s rights and the cultural rights of ethnic minorities . 
it has great importance in international efforts to promote universal respect and observance of human rights . 
today in Canada it is used as an aid to interpret our own Charter of Rights and Freedoms . 
canada not only made a commitment in 1967 to this covenant , Canada helped to draft it . 
canada ' s own signing of it , which came into force in 1976 , is important to the world since , to quote my colleague Senator Raynell Andreychuk when she said on April 28 , 1994 : 
canada is known worldwide for its commitment to human rights and the quality of its democratic institutions . 
civil and political liberties are protected and embraced as fundamental rights in our Charter . 
by June 1997 , 138 countries had ratified this covenant . 
the most recent addition has been China , which announced its intention to sign this covenant on March 12 , 1998 . As a signatory to the ICCPR , Canada must look both within and beyond its borders to help to eradicate egregious human rights violations . 
canada ' s fourth report , deposited with the United Nations in April 1997 , outlined important principles through a number of federal and provincial articles such as the right to self - determination , sexual equality , derogation , preserving rights and right to life , to name but a few . 
these articles are important . 
honourable senators , look around at our democratic institutions . 
we are fortunate to live in a country such as this . 
can you imagine how our deliberations in this place would change if we lived in a society that did not hold these rights so dear ? 
for this we should be thankful , yet feel more responsible to encourage others to uphold values and rights that improve the quality of life for all . 
adoption of International Covenant on Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , aboriginal rights are human rights issues . 
in 1994 , the working group on indigenous people in the United Nations Human Rights Commission adopted the International Covenant on the Rights of Indigenous Nations . 
this covenant is a powerful statement on the rights of indigenous peoples . 
it affirms that they are people equal in dignity and right to all other peoples , while recognizing the rights of all individuals and peoples to be different , to consider themselves different and to be respected as such . 
despite the considerable contribution that aboriginal peoples make by adding diversity and heterogeneity to a national culture , they are subjected to considerable bias and prejudice in many states . 
hill tribes in eastern India , native Indians in Latin America and aboriginal peoples here in Canada , to name a few , have been subjected to particularly humiliating treatment . 
the UN Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights has rebuked Canada ' s acceptance of the deplorable living and housing conditions of our aboriginal peoples . 
the Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples reported on the treatment of aboriginal veterans after the First and Second World Wars and the Korean conflict , noting , in particular , the unacceptable treatment of aboriginal veterans on their return home . 
this is another example . 
inherent in this mistreatment , oftentimes , is the belief that indigenous peoples are somehow inferior or subordinate to mainstream society . 
honourable senators , this is a perception that is morally untenable , malicious and damaging . 
during the Progressive Conservative mandate , perhaps the most notable achievement of that government was the establishment of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples in August 1991 , which examined the economic , social and cultural life of First Nations in Canada . 
the commission ' s report is the benchmark against which subsequent governments will be judged in dealing with First Nations policy . 
the proposed International Covenant on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples highlights the need for all governments to preserve , protect and guarantee the rights and responsibilities of nations and the dignity and inalienable right of all peoples . 
i cannot think of a more urgent human rights issue for the Canadian government to resolve in the fiftieth year of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . 
world War II 
anniversary of Commencement of Siege of Hong Kong 
hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
honourable senators , on this day , December 8 , 1941 , units of the Imperial Japanese Army started their two - week long Hong Kong offensive , an offensive against the British Commonwealth forces defending the then Crown colony . 
two Canadian infantry battalions , the Winnipeg Grenadiers and the Royal Rifles of Canada , some 1,975 soldiers under the command of Brigadier J . K . Lawson , were among those defenders . 
in the intense fighting that followed , 23 officers and 267 men were killed , and 483 were wounded . 
in all , 40 per cent became casualties . 
brigadier Lawson fought the Japanese armed only with his pistol when his headquarters was overrun . 
many of you will be aware that , in an incredible act of bravery , Company Sergeant Major John Osborne was awarded the Victoria Cross posthumously for throwing himself on a hand grenade to save his men . 
after the fall of Hong Kong on Christmas Day in 1941 , 287 Canadians died in captivity due to the brutality of their captors . 
those who survived are only just now being recognized by our country . 
however , Canada ' s actions in the Pacific theatre did not end with Hong Kong . 
the Canadian Army , under Brigadier Harry Foster - a Nova Scotian , I might add - went back with American forces to seize the Aleutian Islands , previously occupied by the Japanese . 
incidentally , Canadian frogmen were active not only there but also in Burma . 
the Royal Canadian Air Force was active against Japanese forces in the Aleutians . 
two transport squadrons were active in Burma , and I was honoured to be part of the Canadian delegation that visited the areas where Canadians served and where those who died were buried . 
a Canadian Canso squadron served in Ceylon . 
one Canadian , Air Commodore Ret ' d Len Birchall , is credited with saving Ceylon , a strategic naval base in the Indian Ocean , from Japanese occupation . 
yes , we do have heroes . 
the Canadian Navy took part in the Aleutian operations , and HMCS Uganda , a cruiser with 700 sailors , served with the Royal Navy in the Pacific . 
Robert Hampton Gray , a naval aviator flying from a Royal Navy aircraft carrier , sank a Japanese destroyer and was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross . 
Canadian merchant vessels sailed bravely throughout the Pacific in that theatre of war . 
honourable senators , on this day , I should like to pass on my personal thanks to the surviving Canadians who served in the Pacific theatre during World War II and to pay tribute to those hundreds of Canadians who sacrificed their lives so that this country might continue to live in freedom . 
united Nations 
fiftieth Anniversary of Signing of International Declaration of Human Rights 
hon. Pierre Claude Nolin : 
honourable senators , next Thursday we will be celebrating the 50 th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , adopted and proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly on December 10 , 1948 . 
in this text , the UN member states proclaimed their faith in the fundamental rights of humankind , the dignity and worth of the individual , and the equality of men and women . 
since 1948 , the United Nations General Assembly has adopted a series of protocols with a view to leading member states to pass legislation in a number of their areas of activity , in order to foster greater respect for human rights in their political , legal and military systems . 
one of these documents is the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights aiming at the Abolition of the Death Penalty , which was adopted and proclaimed by the UN General Assembly on December 15 , 1989 . 
through this protocol , the signatory states , including Canada , agreed with the principle that abolition of the death penalty would contribute to promoting human dignity and the development of human rights . 
convinced that all measures taken toward abolition of this punishment constituted progress with respect to the enjoyment of privacy , the signatories to this document made an international commitment to abolish the death penalty . 
this was fully in line with article 6 of the 1996 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . 
it should be pointed out that this article refers to abolition of the death penalty in terms which unambiguously suggest the desirability of so doing . 
as you know , honourable senators , Canada has upheld this commitment for a long time . 
there has been no execution since 1962 and the death penalty was abolished in 1976 . 
right now , and this will not be the case much longer , the only legislation that still contains references to capital punishment is the National Defence Act , which provides that a soldier found guilty of treason may be sentenced to death . 
if this same soldier has been charged with misconduct in the presence of the enemy or with an offence in combat , he may be sentenced to death if he acted from cowardice . 
in a few months , however , these provisions will be a thing of the past . 
as you know , honourable senators , the Senate recently studied Bill C - 25 , which amends certain provisions of the National Defence Act in order to bring it into line with the principles of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , which guarantee , among other things , the right to life , and with the principles of Canadian criminal law . 
with this bill , the death penalty is no longer deemed necessary as punishment for military offences . 
its abolition will allow Canada to adopt the same position as that of most of the countries with which it maintains close ties . 
first , the death penalty will be abolished for military offences . 
second , it will be replaced by a sentence of life imprisonment , with no eligibility for parole for 25 years for most serious offences related to acts of treason . 
honourable senators , as a Canadian , I am proud to see that , with this bill , Canada is once again assuming its international responsibilities by reforming its policies on human rights and the right to life . 
the National Defence Act goes back to 1950 and it has not been amended since then . 
the death penalty provisions in the military justice system clearly reflect another era , when the threat of another world conflict loomed . 
honourable senators , the reasons that might justify maintaining the death penalty in the Canadian military justice system are therefore almost non - existent nowadays . 
moreover , maintaining this sanction would go against everything that Canada has done in the past 50 years to promote Canadians ' right to life . 
in conclusion , I believe that , with the bill that we passed and that the other place will undoubtedly pass , Parliament is taking a step in the right direction by getting rid of the last mention in its legislation of this most revolting form of punishment . 
we are very pleased to see Canada modernize another part of its legislation for the purpose of promoting human rights and the right to life .

honourable senators , I wish to raise a matter arising out of yesterday ' s proceedings .

solicitor General 
treatment of Protestors at APEC Conference by RCMP - Accountability to Parliament of Staff of Prime Minister ' s Office - Government Position 
hon. No ë l A . Kinsella ( Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
document 00672 is a letter addressed to the Right Honourable Prime Minister , Room 230 , Langevin Block . 
the only good thing I have heard lately about the Langevin Block is that the stone of that building came from the Miramichi area of New Brunswick . 
i invite honourable members to read that letter . 
now , regrettably , as we enter the final planning stages for the AELM , officials from your office have decided - 
officers from the Prime Minister ' s Office have decided - 
- to reduce significantly the area available for line of sight access to the APEC leaders . 
in the second paragraph of that letter , the president of UBC points out that agreement had been reached with the RCMP on a line of sight , and that this line of sight was changed on the orders of officials from the Prime Minister ' s Office . 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham , Leader of the Government : 
honourable senators , members of the Prime Minister ' s staff are responsible to the Prime Minister directly . 
senator Kinsella : 
senator Graham : 
parliament has already established a Public Complaints Commission and , as my honourable friend has suggested , due process is being followed . 
senator Kinsella : 
that is correct . 
senator Graham : 
i remind honourable senators that some time ago , in exchanges between the opposition and myself on this very subject , I referred to a letter that was written by the president of the university to a member of the Prime Minister ' s staff , thanking him for his cooperation and the manner in which provision was made for the complainants and those who wanted to protest or demonstrate . 
it discussed the great cooperation that had been extended to the university by those responsible in order to avoid , as much as possible , any untoward incidents . 
senator Kinsella : 
honourable senators , the evidence is clearly before all honourable senators to read for themselves . 
officials from the Prime Minister ' s Office , whether directly or indirectly under the direction of the Prime Minister , did indeed interfere with the activities of the RCMP . 
the letter from the British Columbia Civil Liberties Associaiton , dated November 30 , states clearly at the top of page two : 
... that the RCMP appear to have sacrificed the rights and liberties of Canadian citizens so as to further the purely political objectives of the Prime Minister ' s Office ( PMO ) . 
honourable senators , we will not be duped by the fallacious argument that the RCMP Public Complaints Commission is able to examine the conduct of the Prime Minister or officials in the Prime Minister ' s Office . 
parliament is the body to which the Prime Minister and officials in the Prime Minister ' s Office are accountable . 
what vehicle of Parliament would the Leader of the Government envisage us using to hold the Prime Minister accountable for these actions ? 
senator Graham : 
senator Kinsella has selected a portion of the same letter some of which I read the other day . 
it is dated November 30 and addressed to me . 
presumably there was one addressed to the Leader of the Opposition as well . 
allow me to draw your attention to the concluding paragraphs of that letter . 
... should a court decide that the current PCC panel is unable to continue , we favour the immediate appointment of a new panel to hear our complaints . 
it should not be up to the government of the day , or the RCMP , to decide when and how such complaints are to be investigated . 
the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association says in the concluding sentence of their letter : 
in short , we have unfinished business with the PCC , and we are not prepared to stand idly by and see this process derailed . 
senator Kinsella : 
honourable senators , many complainants file complaints under that process . 
as of yesterday , the RCMP officers and their counsel have asked that that process be abandoned . 
the students , who represent the vast majority of complainants , through their counsel , have expressed non - confidence in that process . 
the chairman of the appointed panel has resigned , alleging interference from the chairperson of the council . 
the former solicitor general has also taken the fall . 
we in Parliament have the responsibility to hold accountable every official , including the first minister . 
we should not be intimidated or shrink away from that responsibility . 
as the CBC program last week pointed out , there have been inquiries conducted by Parliament in the past , even though other tribunals were examining the same issue within their mandates . 
what would obviate either a parliamentary committee or a judicial inquiry examining this matter , even though the Public Complaints Commission process would be under way ? 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , the Public Complaints Commission is a quasi - judicial body . 
there are matters now before the Federal Court . 
we are following due process . 
the Chief of Staff in the Prime Minister ' s Office and the former director of operations for the Prime Minister have volunteered to appear before the commission . 
it is up to the Public Complaints Commission to determine how it will proceed . 
the government , even if it wanted to , could not end the hearings . 
i suggest that we allow those hearings to continue , and that we follow due process in this country . 
hon. Terry Stratton : 
honourable senators , I wish to continue with the same line of questioning regarding APEC . 
it concerns something called " credibility . " 
as we all know , Gerald Morin , the chairman of the three person committee , has resigned . 
the lawyer for the RCMP has vowed that he will fight the continuation of the commission ' s proceedings . 
Morin resigned because Shirley Heafey , chair of the RCMP Public Complaints Commission , asked him to read a letter at the hearings that ordered the commission ' s lawyer , Chris Considine , to represent the students ' complaints . 
the chair interfered by picking the counsel who would then deal with the matters in the Federal Court , which Morin said was highly improper . 
Heafey openly criticized Morin for hiring a private investigator to investigate a break - in of his car and of the panel ' s Vancouver office . 
has this government initiated an investigation into Ms Heafey ' s conduct regarding her alleged interference in the conduct and operations of the Public Complaints Commission . 
if not , will it ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , the answer to the honourable senator ' s " if not " question is : " Not to my knowledge . " 
under the circumstances , as I understand them and as I have outlined them , that would be inappropriate , because the Public Complaints Commission is at arm ' s length from the government . 
as I stated earlier , even if the government wanted to stop the commission , it does not have the power or the authority to do so . 
the commission consists of a chair , a vice - chair and a member for each of the contracting provinces , as well as no more than three other members . 
once appointed by the Governor in Council , each member holds office during good behaviour and may only be removed for cause . 
Mr. Morin has resigned for his own personal reasons . 
he has also stated publicly , and , as I understand it , he is on record , as I understand it , as saying , that he has full confidence in the remaining two members of the panel . 
i suggest that we allow them to get on with the job . 
senator Stratton : 
honourable senators , the question the government should be asking is whether or not this inquiry has any credibility left in the eyes of Canadians . 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , if the government were interfering with the commission , then the honourable senator would be singing another tune . 
this government believes in due process . 
we also believe in transparency , as indicated by the documents that we tabled today . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
like the Somalia inquiry ? 
some Hon. Senators : 
shame ! 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
what about the Airbus and due process ? 
national Defence 
transfer of Responsibility for Search and Rescue Capability to Sea King Bases - Possible Transfer of Other Equipment - Government Position 
hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
honourable senators , since the government of the day has sought to transfer primary responsibility for search and rescue to the Sea King fleet in Nova Scotia , almost to the same degree as on the West Coast , which is virtual abdication of responsibility , when will the government transfer search and rescue duties , as well as search and rescue equipment , to the key bases from which that search and rescue equipment comes ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I will have to take that question under advisement . 
senator Forrestall poses interesting questions on these matters . 
as I indicated earlier , his knowledge of the military in this country , and , indeed , of military history in general , is very impressive . 
he illustrated his knowledge in his statement today when he made reference to the Japanese , Hong Kong , and so on . 
senator Forrestall : 
how many are working ? 
senator Graham : 
that is a good question . 
senator Forrestall : 
none of them ! 
senator Graham : 
it is a fair question . 
i inquired about that very matter this morning . 
i understand that it is hoped that all of the Labradors will be operational by Friday of this week . 
with respect to Sea Kings , there are two based at Shearwater and 20 at Patricia Bay , which is on Vancouver Island near Esquimalt . 
my understanding is that the Canadian Forces are responsible for having 10 helicopters out of the 30 that I mentioned ready to fly at any given time . 
search and Rescue Capability - Grounding of Labrador Helicopter Fleet - Government Position 
hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
honourable senators , I am one of those Canadians who sincerely hope and pray that those Labradors do not fly again anywhere . 
we still do not know what caused the crash of theLabrador 305 , yet the Labradors are still flying . 
would the Canadian Transportation Safety Board not have something to say about that , were it their responsibility ? 
the T - 58 F engine on the Labrador exploded after it was turned off . 
i want honourable senators to listen to this for a moment , because it will give some insight into the problems . 
it is clear that using 35 - year - old helicopters is like rolling the dice . 
when will the government ground the Labrador fleet ? 
how can the government justify stalling on the initiative that must be taken sooner rather than later on a call for maritime patrol helicopters ? 
the Sea King is stretched to its limits with its additional search and rescue duty . 
it is now just a matter of time until we have a serious incident with one of those aircraft , which like the Labrador are over 35 years of age and are based on the technology of the late 1940 s or early 1950 s . 
this is the late 1990 s . 
when will these helicopters be grounded ? 
when will we admit that we made a political mistake , which was made in the heat of campaigning ? 
i refer to the cancellation of the contract for the supply of EH - 101 helicopters . 
we would have had 12 of those helicopters by now had that contract not been cancelled . 
they could have been pressed into service in search and rescue . 
senator Ghitter : 
shame ! 
senator Forrestall : 
in the name of God , will the government ground these forsaken aircraft before the lives of any more of our Canadian men and women are taken ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , the Honourable Senator Forrestall contends that 12 of the helicopters that the previous government had proposed to purchase would now be available . 
however , that is not my information . 
my information is that those helicopters would not be available until late next year . 
a decision was taken by one government , as opposed to a decision that had been taken by another . 
let us talk about the word " grounded . " 
it is an important term that has been used extensively in this particular exchange . 
it is an official DND term that refers to an entire fleet of aircraft and not to a single aircraft . 
for example , all of the Labradors or all of the Sea Kings could be grounded , but one could not ground an individual helicopter . 
" grounded " status is determined by the Chief of the Air Staff . 
i must say to Senator Forrestall that I am not passing the buck here , because we went over this ground last week , and we plowed it thoroughly . 
as I said , the final responsibility rests with the Minister of National Defence and with the government . 
senator Forrestall : 
honourable senators , I have one final comment . 
yesterday we all witnessed the bravery and skill of civilian helicopter pilots when they snatched from the jaws of death three of the passengers on that ill - fated flight from Baie - Comeau to Rimouski . 
i should like to be the first among all Canadians presumptuous enough to suggest that those two men are deserving of the highest award for bravery that Canada can offer . 
in saying that , I extend my admiration to all those men and women who get into the cockpits of Labrador and Sea King aircraft . 
will the minister consider this suggestion ? 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , I would join with Senator Forrestall in paying tribute to the heroic rescue efforts that took place yesterday when the aircraft went down between Baie - Comeau and Rimouski . 
i hope that we can all pursue the matter of an appropriate award for all who were involved . 
senator Forrestall raised the question of the HMCS Halifax . 
i just want to hitchhike on this particular question . 
senator Forrestall : 
be careful ! 
senator Graham : 
i may be opening myself up , as I usually do , for another frontal attack , but I want to comment further on our discussion yesterday with regard to the frigate HMCS Halifax incident that took place off the coast of Newfoundland . 
it is important for us to understand that the Halifax was conducting a fisheries patrol mission when it received the so - called " tasking " to rescue the injured fisherman . 
while Canadian Forces ships may from time to time carry a Sea King helicopter during fisheries patrol missions , it was not considered a priority by the military for that particular mission . 
in addition , I should point out that dangerous icing conditions prevented the Labrador in Gander from participating in the search . 
that is very important for purposes of clarification . 
senator Forrestall : 
it was out on another mission , no doubt . 
senator Graham : 
given those factors , bringing the fisherman to shore by ship was the fastest and the safest option available . 
senator Comeau : 
and the only option . 
senator Graham : 
No. I mentioned that icing conditions prevented the Labrador in Gander from reaching the ship . 
senator Berntson : 
that was not an option . 
senator Graham : 
i would add that those on board the HMCS Halifax , particularly the medical personnel , provided excellent care to the injured fisherman until he was able to be safely transported to a hospital . 
i believe - and I am sure that Senator Forrestall and all honourable senators would agree - that our Canadian Forces personnel make decisions based on years of experience . 
they did what was appropriate under the circumstances . 
again , I believe they deserve our thanks and congratulations for the work they do . 
solicitor General 
commission of Inquiry into Treatment of Protestors at APEC Conference by RCMP - Reasons for Continuing Mandate of Public Complaints Commission - Government Position 
hon. Brenda M. Robertson : 
honourable senators , my question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate is rather straightforward and returns to fundamental principles . 
i am reverting to the APEC problem . 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , the answer is a simple " yes " because , again , we are following due process . 
the Public Complaints Commission was established to do exactly the job that it is supposed to be doing under the mandate which was provided by Parliament under the direction of the previous government . 
senator Robertson : 
i thank the honourable leader for that answer . 
that is interesting . 
efficacy of Security Arrangements at 1999 Francophonie Conference in Moncton , New Brunswick - Government Position 
hon. Brenda M. Robertson : 
i have a supplementary question relating to the Francophonie Conference due to be held in Moncton in September . 
does the Leader of the Government not agree that the inquiry into alleged misconduct at last year ' s APEC summit could result in some valuable lessons for all those involved in the organization and the security arrangements at the Francophonie Conference ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
absolutely . 
i am sure that those involved have already learned some valuable lessons , and I hope they will be taken into account when they are preparing for the important international session of the Francophonie Conference in Moncton next year . 
senator Robertson : 
what assurances can the Leader of the Government provide this chamber that the work of the inquiry will be finished so that the results may be of benefit to the organizers of the Francophonie Conference ? 
if the leader cannot provide assurances , would he not agree that the collapse of the complaints panel and the admission by the head of the Public Complaints Commission that , although she believes that the panel should continue its work but she is not sure how , provide a compelling argument to establish a fast - track , independent or parliamentary inquiry to get the information that is required to prepare for the security of the Francophonie Conference ? 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , there is a matter before the Federal Court which must be decided before the Public Complaints Commission can proceed . 
as I indicated the other day , the judge involved has expressed a hope that the Chief Justice will be able to take steps to provide an answer to the questions before the Federal Court at an early date . 
we hope that the Public Complaints Commission will be able to get on with its work . 
all of the evidence provided before the Public Complaints Commission will be public . 
it is a public forum . 
all of the documents presented to the commission will be transparent and made public . 
i do not think it is necessary for anyone to wait for the final report of the chair , or of the Public Complaints Commission , to learn lessons from the incidents that occurred in Vancouver last year during the APEC Conference , and to apply those lessons to the important conference upcoming in Moncton next year . 
senator Robertson : 
honourable senators , I disagree , but I will come back to the question at another date . 
precincts of Parliament 
Christmas Lights on Parliament Hill - Request to Extend Show until after Orthodox Christmas Celebrations - Government Position 
hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , I would point out to the Leader of the Government in the Senate that , every year , the lights on Parliament Hill are turned on with great fanfare at a ceremony attended by the Governor General . 
it is often televised and shown across Canada . 
those lights stay on during the festive season , reminding us of the meaning of Christmas and New Year . 
this is also a time when our Jewish colleagues reflect upon their celebrations . 
however , the Orthodox community has brought to my attention that those of us who celebrate a different calendar - our Christmas Eve is January 6 and Christmas Day is January 7 - feel that we are not being taken into account on the celebrations on the Hill because the lights are generally turned off about January 3 . 
in their opinion , it is not a special favour , but one for which there is a broad base of consensus . 
to give them an opportunity to reflect on the Hill with the lights on would be a benefit . 
these groups have approached the NCC . 
the NCC has been ambivalent at best , saying that they will take the request under consideration , but they do not seem to be moving on it . 
would the Prime Minister and the cabinet intervene to keep the lights on ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I thank Honourable Senator Andreychuk for bringing this matter to our attention . 
the people to whom she refers have made an enormous contribution to growth and development in every province of our country . 
for those of us of a particular faith , January 6 is also the feast of the Epiphany . 
if I could keep the lights on right through the end of January , I should love to do so . 
they add some great joy on rather dark evenings for those of us who spend much time in these precincts . 
if Senator DeWare could put a blue light among all those red lights - red being the traditional light of choice , no matter which government is in office - on the Christmas tree for the festivities that took place here last night , I will certainly bring Senator Andreychuk ' s request to the attention of my colleagues . 
we will use whatever persuasive powers we can possibly muster to encourage the National Capital Commission to keep those lights on as long as possible . 
senator Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , I should advise that the request came to me through the Orthodox community , but there are certain sections of the Catholic community who also celebrate the Julian calendar . 
it is a broad - based request and I would ask your government to consider it . 
senator Graham : 
again , honourable senators , I thank Senator Andreychuk for bringing this matter before the chamber . 
Cape Breton Development Corporation 
possible Negotiations on Sale of Corporation - Further Consultations with Cabinet Colleagues - Position of Leader of the Government 
hon. Lowell Murray : 
honourable senators , I should like to return to a question I raised yesterday concerning the plans of the government with regard to the privatization of the Cape Breton Development Corporation . 
notwithstanding the categorical statements made by the Leader of the Government in the Senate yesterday to the effect that no one authorized to speak for the government is engaged in discussions with anyone in the private sector concerning the possible sale of Devco , the Canadian Press reports this morning that the privatization of Devco is expected to be announced before January 1 . 
further , it reports , specifically contrary to the statement of my honourable friend , that Ottawa is talking to a Nova Scotia group and two American firms about Devco assets . 
does he have any reason to reconsider the categorical statements he made yesterday on this matter ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
i stand by the answers that I gave yesterday . 
i do not know where the Canadian Press got its information . 
i repeat that no one has been authorized by the Government of Canada to negotiate , in any way , shape or form , the sale of Devco . 
orders OF THE DAY 
competition Act 
bill to Amend - Third Reading - Debate Adjourned 
hon. Nicholas W . Taylor : 
honourable senators , I do not know who will be responsible for giving the speech to close the debate on third reading . 
however , I ask that whoever wraps up the bill answer the questions on wiretapping that were put forward by the Canadian Bar Association and circulated on November 18 . 
in particular , in reference to wiretaps , why was clause 47 not deleted from Bill C - 20 ? 
on motion of Senator Tkachuk , debate adjourned . 
tobacco Act 
bill to Amend - Second Reading 
on the Order : 
resuming debate on the motion of the honourable Senator Mahovlich , seconded by the honourable Senator Butts , for the second reading of Bill C - 42 , to amend the Tobacco Act . 
hon. Th é r è se Lavoie - Roux : 
honourable senators , allow me to address the proposed amendment to Bill C - 42 , to amend the Tobacco Act . 
i wish to emphasize an important point in broaching this issue . 
central to this bill is the concern for the health of Canadians , in particular , of young Canadians . 
this is a concern that all parliamentarians share , as evidenced on a number of occasions by the strong support on both sides of the House and this chamber for the government ' s endeavours to discourage smoking . 
this issue touches all our lives as we have all been affected by the loss of someone dear to a smoking related disease , such as lung cancer or heart disease . 
this is an issue which touches our conscience since smoking kills . 
our responsibility is one of protecting the well - being of Canadians . 
if we look at statistics on the health of Canadians , we can see that , every year , more than 40,000 Canadians die of tobacco related illnesses . 
that is more than 100 a day . 
according to one report , in 1991 , 45,064 Canadians died of a tobacco related illness . 
and the forecast is 47,000 by the year 2000 . 
in Quebec , one person in four dies of cancer . 
this is one of the highest rates in the world . 
furthermore , 300 non - smokers die of lung cancer every year as a result of second - hand smoke . 
children are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effect of smoke . 
because they breathe faster than adults do , they inhale larger volumes of air and therefore more pollutants . 
because they weigh less and are developing , children are also more susceptible to the adverse effects of toxins . 
we must protect them , as we must protect infants who are born smaller because their mother smoked or was exposed to smoke during pregnancy . 
adults can decide whether or not they want to smoke , the choice is theirs , but children and infants are victims , because the choice is not theirs . 
honourable senators , we have a responsibility , in fact a duty , to protect our children and to remove hazards that may threaten them . 
smoking among young people is one of the most distressing aspects of the problem . 
the statistics are alarming . 
they reveal that young people are smoking more and more , and Health Canada points out that 27 per cent of young people between the ages of 15 and 17 are smoking and that the figure reaches 37 per cent in the case of 19 - year - olds . 
according to the Canadian Medical Association , 500,000 young Canadians will start smoking in the next five years , and research indicates that tobacco will shorten the life of half of them . 
young people think they are invincible , but that is far from the case . 
we must fight this epidemic and do everything to prevent our young people from giving in to the primary cause of avoidable death in Canada . 
perhaps this is not realistic , given our belief in a free and democratic society , although it would certainly address the problem more directly . 
the government has adopted a variety of approaches in working towards a solution : public education , taxation , and legislation . 
as you will recall , our colleagues Senator Kenny and Senator Nolin proposed a bill calling for a 50 - cent levy on each carton of cigarettes , which would have yielded a fund of $ 120 million each year to put into educational programs aimed at discouraging smoking . 
we unanimously supported Bill S - 13 in the Senate , but it was defeated in the House of Commons . 
i am sure many of you received representation requesting that the government accept Bill S - 13 . 
instead , the Minister of Health proposes to spend only $ 20 million each year on its tobacco control strategy over the next five years . 
another approach that the government has taken to reduce tobacco consumption in Canada has been by means of legislation . 
bill C - 42 , the legislation at hand , seeks to amend section 24 of the Tobacco Act . 
this bill proposes to phase in the Tobacco Act by phasing out tobacco sponsorship programs over the next five years . 
i understand that Air Canada has already indicated its interest in sponsoring the Grand Prix auto race , and I wonder if finding alternative sponsors for the arts and sports events in question is such a difficult task as to warrant the introduction of a bill such as this Bill C - 42 . 
honourable senators , I am gravely concerned about the changes proposed by Bill C - 42 . 
we in the Senate have an opportunity to give sober second thought to legislation passed in the House of Commons . 
i certainly urge you to give careful consideration to Bill C - 42 . 
this bill postpones the primary intent of the Tobacco Act , which is to stop exposing our young people to a dangerous product . 
each year we lose waiting , thousands of adolescents , as many as 250,000 according to some observers , become hooked or dependent on cigarettes . 
do we really mean it when we say we want to protect our young people ? 
should we not think of them first ? 
naturally they do not have the voice of the tobacco industry or cultural or sporting event sponsors such as the promoters of the Grand Prix or the Jazz Festival . 
i have nothing against such events . 
not so long ago , I really enjoyed playing tennis . 
these events should not have priority over the health of our young people . 
there has been significant controversy over Bill C - 42 in the House of Commons . 
i will not attempt to review each logistical problem which our colleagues outlined , but a number of amendments proposed by the Canadian Cancer Society , and endorsed by all four opposition parties , were overlooked when Bill C - 42 was adopted in the House of Commons last week . 
i am sure you must have received representation from the Canadian Cancer Society , as I have on several occasions lately , regarding Bill C - 42 . 
one amendment to Bill C - 42 would place a ceiling on money which tobacco companies could spend on sponsorship advertising over the next five years . 
as it stands , until the Tobacco Act comes into full effect , Bill C - 42 allows tobacco companies to pour ever - increasing amounts of money into advertising their products at arts and sports events . 
they could revive events they previously sponsored . 
we cannot count on them to impose limitations on promotion ; we must take leadership . 
tobacco companies increased their expenditures on sponsorship from $ 10 million in 1967 to $ 16 million in 1996 when a loophole was found in the former Tobacco Product Control Act . 
we need to contain the problem and not allow it to be perpetuated at the expense of our youth . 
another concern is the way in which the legislation is drafted . 
it does not guarantee the allocation of funding of $ 60 million over five years for educational programs . 
it is imperative that , five years from now , the federal government is as bound to its commitment as it presently tells us it is . 
honourable senators , we must not fight this battle in a half - hearted way . 
bill C - 42 could have serious consequences , and we must not rush to adopt it . 
banning tobacco advertising and sponsorship is a progressive measure , and we must not postpone it without due consideration . 
our response must match the magnitude of this problem . 
let us stand by the vast majority of Canadians who want the government to discourage young people from becoming addicted to smoking . 
i urge you to consider Bill C - 42 with all the attention it requires . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
if no other honourable senator wishes to speak , I will proceed with the motion for second reading . 
it was moved by Honourable Senator Mahovlich , seconded by Honourable Senator Butts , that is this bill be read the second time . 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
motion agreed to and bill read second time . 
referred to Committee 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
when shall this bill be read the third time ? 
extradition Bill 
second Reading - Debate Adjourned 
honourable senators , I am pleased to have the opportunity today to speak to Bill C - 40 on extradition . 
this bill is very important because it introduces a modern and effective system for handling extradition requests . 
it gives Canadians an appropriate legal tool with which to respect our international commitments . 
this bill will provide much needed modernization to our extradition law . 
as was mentioned in the other place , the present Extradition Act , which is of general application , and the Fugitive Offenders Act , which applies to the extradition process between Commonwealth countries , both date from the end of the nineteenth century . 
both are more than one hundred years old . 
some amendments to the extradition appeal process were made six years ago , but the rest of these statutes have remained the same since that time . 
society , however , has evolved a lot in the last decades ; so has criminality . 
modern criminality includes telemarketing fraud , theft of information by computer , using the Internet to commit an offence in another jurisdiction , international drug trade , and other transborder crimes . 
canada is now seriously involved in the fight against international and global crime ; our country is a member of a number of international bodies that are addressing this crime problem . 
we therefore need to strengthen our legislation and eliminate its deficiencies . 
all of the bodies which have considered the serious problem of transnational organized crime have identified extradition as a critical instrument to combat this growing threat to world peace . 
with Bill C - 40 we now have the possibility of extraditing fugitives to the international criminal tribunals which have been established by the United Nations Security Council for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia . 
honourable senators will recall that our compatriot Madam Justice Louise Arbour is the chief prosecutor . 
we shall thus reaffirm Canada ' s strong support for the work of such bodies in bringing to justice those responsible for genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity . 
bill C - 40 allows extradition based on a bilateral treaty or multilateral convention , or when the requesting state or entity is designated as a partner in the schedule to the bill . 
the bill also permits the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to enter into agreement for extradition with any state or entity on a case - by - case basis . 
the bill will also apply to all requests for extradition made by Canada to a foreign state . 
one concern about the present extradition process is that countries requesting the extradition of a fugitive submit their request according to a fairly narrow approach to what is acceptable evidence . 
this creates real difficulty , especially for countries working under a civil law system , which accept a wider variety of forms of evidence . 
the new legislation allows more latitude in admitting different forms of evidence while retaining the same legal standard for extradition . 
a Canadian judge will still have to be satisfied that there is sufficient evidence of the conduct underlying the request for extradition - conduct that , if it occurred in Canada , would justify trial for a criminal offence . 
lawyers refer to this as the prima facie test . 
what would be modified is the form of evidence that could be presented to the extraditing judge . 
this approach addresses the current difficult evidentiary requirement for first - person affidavits , devoid of hearsay , which is the main problem encountered by states requesting extradition from Canada . 
experience shows that it is already extremely difficult for states to meet the prima facie standard in relation to certain types of modern crime , for example , complicated fraud . 
when we say " extremely difficult , " we mean extremely difficult . 
it can take years to prepare these cases . 
it can require hundreds of affidavits from countries around the world just to conduct the extradition case in Canada . 
with the increasing complexity of transborder and international crime , the process will be more difficult in the future . 
with Bill C - 40 , the judge would admit into evidence documentation contained in a record of the case . 
this record could contain evidence gathered according to the rules and procedures followed in the requesting state . 
the objective is to accept the evidence in the form used by the foreign state , provided that it is sufficient , according to a Canadian extraditing judge , to demonstrate criminal conduct under Canadian law , and to require a trial in the requesting state . 
this record of the case would be certified by appropriate authorities in the requesting state . 
it would be accompanied by certain assurances in relation to issues such as the availability of evidence , its sufficiency for prosecution purposes , or its accuracy . 
honourable senators , it is important to note that the notion of a record of the case is consistent with recent Supreme Court of Canada decisions on hearsay . 
in these decisions , the Supreme Court abandoned the strict formalism of the hearsay rule and adopted a more flexible standard based on necessity and circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness . 
the bill strengthens the guarantees accorded fugitives . 
by submitting the file of a person sought for extradition , requesting authorities will have to certify in Canada not only that evidence is available for a trial , but also , in the case of a common law system , for example , that it is sufficient to justify a trial in this country . 
the person sought for extradition will have a better view of the case , as they will see a summary of evidence as opposed to just affidavits on particular elements . 
to conclude on the issue of evidence , I will say that " the record of the case for all states " options seems to be the best compromise between the present impractical evidentiary requirements and the absence of any judicial assessment of the evidence . 
bill C - 40 is well balanced , because it establishes procedural guarantees and human rights for the fugitive , while making the extradition process more accessible to countries with legal systems and evidence rules that are different from ours . 
honourable senators , Bill C - 40 also improves considerably the procedure for extradition . 
this process should be clear , and the written statute should detail the nature of the process and the protections accorded to the those who are the subject of extradition proceedings . 
in this bill , the current two - track system is maintained . 
the judicial track will continue to ensure that the underlying conduct would be criminal in Canada and that there is a case against the person . 
the Minister of Justice will have responsibility for assessing the foreign legal system to ensure that human rights are respected , and that a fair trial will be provided in the requesting state . 
one very important feature of the bill outlines the mandatory and discretionary grounds for the refusal of surrender to the requesting state by the minister : political offence , lack of jurisdiction , death penalty , humanitarian considerations , previous acquittal or conviction , and trial in absentia . 
under no circumstance shall the minister make a surrender order if she or he is satisfied that the surrender would be unjust or oppressive , or that extradition has been sought for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing the person by reason of race , nationality , ethnic origin , colour , language , religion , political opinions , sex , sexual orientation , age , status , or physical or mental handicap . 
the minister retains the discretion to decide in each specific case whether it is appropriate to seek assurances from the extradition partner that capital punishment will not be imposed . 
in the case of a person under the age of 18 at the time of the alleged commission of the crime , the minister has the discretion to refuse to make a surrender order if satisfied that the fundamental principles established in the Young Offenders Act to protect the young person are not respected . 
in making this decision , the minister can consider the particular circumstances of the case . 
the safeguards referred to in the legislation are , of course , in addition to the protection provided by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . 
another important feature of this bill is that it will harmonize the extradition and refugee processes . 
conflict may arise when a person is subject to an extradition request and makes a claim for refugee status . 
in order to avoid the duplication of decision - making , the bill establishes a means for consultation between the Minister of Justice and the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration in such matters . 
the bill establishes that the decision on the refugee status will be adjourned until the final decision on extradition is rendered . 
honourable senators will note in the bill a delightful new legal term , " the virtual presence " of witnesses . 
these new provisions can be used in any criminal proceeding , including extradition , when witnesses cannot be brought before the court because they are outside Canada , or when they are in another part of Canada and circumstances preclude their attendance . 
with respect to video and audio link evidence from Canada to a foreign state , the foreign state ' s laws relating to evidence and procedure would apply as though the person testifying in Canada were physically before the foreign court , but only if the evidence would not disclose information that is protected by the Canadian law on non - disclosure of information of privilege . 
Canadian law relating to contempt of court , perjury and contradictory evidence would apply to these witnesses , whether they are testifying from Canada to a foreign state or from outside Canada to Canada . 
if the witness is elsewhere in Canada , the court could order that the evidence be provided by video or audio link if it is appropriate considering all the circumstances . 
if the witness is outside Canada , the evidence will be received if its reception would not be contrary to the principles of fundamental justice . 
these provisions represent a change in oral evidence that reflects the realities of modern life and the rights of the accused . 
in summary , honourable senators , Bill C - 40 makes our extradition process more accessible to foreign states , brings our extradition procedures and practices closer to those of other countries and , most important , prevents Canada from becoming a safe haven for fugitives from justice . 
i believe that it merits our support . 
on motion of Senator Beaudoin , debate adjourned . 
royal Canadian Mint Act Currency Act 
bill to Amend - Second Reading - Debate Adjourned 
honourable senators , it is always a great honour to have the opportunity to talk about a Canadian institution that has done such a good job of protecting and promoting the symbols of our nation and , consequently , our identity . 
i am referring of course to the Canadian Mint . 
established more than 90 years ago , the Mint supplies Canadians and international customers with high - quality coins at reasonable cost and on time . 
the Mint is the only corporation mandated to produce , sell and distribute coins in Canada . 
the Mint balances this important role against that of a commercial entity required to make a profit for its shareholder : the Government of Canada . 
it does so by selling on the global market its monetary products and services , which account for 70 per cent of the mint ' s revenues and help reduce the overall cost of producing Canadian circulation coins . 
it was over 10 years ago that Parliament amended the Royal Canadian Mint Act to improve the organization ' s trading pattern . 
throughout this decade , as the global market and economy were developing at an ever - increasing speed , we have not been monitoring these changes ; we waited too long to make the necessary changes . 
honourable senators , I am pleased to speak to Bill C - 41 and to share with you a number of proposed government amendments to the Royal Canadian Mint Act . 
we must amend the act that currently governs the Mint , so that it will better reflect current markets and will , through greater business flexibility , seize good business opportunities . 
many parts of the legislative text are of an administrative nature . 
the approval process for the new circulation coins would remain the prerogative of the House of Commons and the Senate . 
the changes to the composition of circulation coins would continue to be governed by regulations . 
the process to approve non - circulation coins would be streamlined , so as to be more efficient and allow the Mint to respond more quickly to the demand of ever changing markets , in a very competitive environment . 
the Mint would now have the authority to determine and change the characteristics of non - circulation coins , except for their design . 
the minister responsible for the Mint would be the only one with the authority to change the design of these coins . 
the Mint would therefore be more receptive to the market and its clientele , while being accountable for the major issue of the design , since related decisions will be made by an elected representative . 
bill C - 41 also proposes minor administrative changes to the Royal Canadian Mint Act to increase the redeemability of $ 1 and $ 2 coins . 
however , the major and necessary changes are found in clauses that give the Royal Canadian Mint greater flexibility to achieve its objective of becoming the world leader in the coin trade sector . 
honourable senators , with Bill C - 41 , the government is proposing to give to the Mint the powers of a natural person , to provide it with the necessary flexibility to achieve its long - term strategic thrust , and fulfil its vision of becoming the world leader in its area . 
the powers of a natural person will permit it to fulfil this public role of producing Canadian coins and making a profit . 
these powers will place the Mint on an equal footing , not only with other successful commercial Crown corporations but also - and equally important - with its main competitors , the mints of other governments such as the United Kingdom , Austria and Germany . 
these new powers will increase the Mint ' s competitive edge and its ability to react to today ' s world markets , for it must be constantly on the watch for new opportunities and sufficiently flexible to respond to them . 
in order to break into the international coinage market , a great deal of experience is not the only thing needed ; the Mint must be forward - looking and sufficiently competitive to grasp the opportunities that arise and to get its share of the market . 
this requires it to have the proper tools , including adequate borrowing power . 
that is why the government proposes enhancing its borrowing power . 
honourable senators , I must repeat that this necessary amendment ought to come as a surprise to no one , since the matter has not been debated for 10 years . 
this increased borrowing power will make it possible to give the Royal Canadian Mint the flexibility and room to manoeuvre the market requires . 
any prudent business re - examines its borrowing power regularly , in order to be able to react in an efficient and timely manner . 
there is one thing we can be sure of : as it exercises its new powers and wishes to take advantage of its new borrowing power , the Mint will still be subject to the same rigorous responsibility structure as it is at present . 
the proposed changes to the Royal Canadian Mint Act and the Currency Act will equip the Mint with the tools it requires to continue to serve Canadians well and to be competitive internationally . 
honourable senators , the Mint ' s success will mean higher exports of Canadian technology and know - how , which will create many jobs for Canadians . 
the Mint is a symbol of the Canadian spirit , and the coins it produces are a proud illustration of our heritage . 
the Mint is known around the world for the excellent quality and economic production of its coins . 
it has served Canadians well for 90 years and we want to ensure that it continues to do so . 
in closing , honourable senators , I respectfully submit that , because of Bill C - 41 , the Mint will be up to the task ahead . 
it will be able to carry out its mandate and better able to go on serving Canadians . 
second Reading 
honourable senators , Bill C - 60 , also known as Appropriation Bill No. 4 , 1998 - 99 , is seeking parliamentary authority to grant to Her Majesty certain sums of money as provided for in the Supplementary Estimates ( B ) 1998 - 99 , in the amount of $ 3 billion . 
supplementary Estimates describe the government ' s need for additional supply . 
the Supplementary Estimates ( B ) 1998 - 99 , the second Supplementary Estimates for this fiscal year , were tabled in the Senate on October 29 , 1998 , and were then referred to the Standing Senate Committee on National Finance for examination . 
our committee heard from Treasury Board officials Richard Neville and Andrew Lieff , who appeared before our committee on November 18 and 26 , 1998 . 
the Supplementary Estimates ( B ) 1998 - 99 were voted on and adopted in the National Finance Committee meeting of December 3 . 
the chairman of the committee , Senator Terry Stratton , presented the committee ' s seventh report later that same day . 
that report was adopted in this chamber yesterday . 
honourable senators , these Supplementary Estimates are consistent with the government ' s budget of February 24 , 1998 , and include the expenditures for the fisheries adjustment and restructuring for Atlantic Canada and British Columbia , as well as certain other items which were not specifically identified or sufficiently developed when the Main Estimates 1998 - 99 were introduced . 
some of these major items include the following . 
there is provision for an amount of $ 628.1 million to two departments , Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Human Resources Development Canada , for the Canadian Fisheries Adjustment and Restructuring initiatives to address the impact of the TAGS program on individuals , communities and provinces on the East Coast , and the introduction of adjustment and restructuring initiatives for the West Coast fisheries . 
as well , some $ 473.7 million will be granted to 76 various departments and agencies under the carry - forward provision to meet operational requirements originally provided for in 1997 - 98 . 
this provision reflects the government ' s approach to reduce year - end spending and to improve cash management . 
it allows managers to carry forward , from one fiscal year to the next , an amount of up to 5 per cent of their operating budget of the previous year , including salaries , operating expenses and minor capital expenditures . 
some $ 272.4 million will be granted to 19 departments regarding the year 2000 date computer problems . 
the primary objective of this allocation is the removal of financial impediments to departments resolving the year 2000 system compliance issues . 
the Department of National Defence will receive $ 236 million for partial payments to the provinces for natural disaster assistance , including the January 1998 ice storm and the floods in several provinces , under the Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements . 
some $ 180.5 million will be granted to 55 departments and agencies for collective agreements ' compensation and adjustments concluded to date . 
collective bargaining resumed in early 1997 , and this amount represents retroactive and ongoing incremental salary costs for 1998 - 1999 . 
human Resources Development Canada will receive $ 98.3 million for the Canadian Opportunities Strategy , as announced in the 1998 Budget . 
funding is also included for the operating costs of the strategy and contributions for its Youth at Risk Program . 
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation will be granted $ 88.4 million for separation payments under their Early Departure Incentive and Early Retirement Incentive Programs . 
some $ 69.6 million will be granted to the Canadian Space Agency for further investments in three major space projects , including the Radarsat - II Program . 
the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade will receive $ 88.4 million to provide certain provinces with their share of the revenues from fees paid by softwood lumber exporters . 
five departments will receive $ 60 million for the Gathering Strength : 
some $ 58.5 million will be granted to Industry Canada for SchoolNet , the Community Access Program , and related initiatives connecting Canadians to the Information Highway . 
health Canada will receive $ 58 million for priority health initiatives , including public education programs of the tobacco control initiative , the development of the Canadian Health Info - Structure , strengthening blood safety and surveillance activities , as well as the implementation of the Aboriginal Head Start On - Reserve Program . 
these major items amount to $ 2.28 billion of the $ 3 billion for which the government is seeking Parliament ' s approval today . 
the balance of the $ .72 billion is spread among a number of other departments of which the specific details are included in these Supplementary Estimates . 
their performance was excellent . 
the committee was impressed with their openness and their proper respect for this committee ' s function as a parliamentary committee reviewing the administrative task of scrutinizing government expenditures . 
the entire committee was struck by the work of these two gentlemen . 
we were extremely appreciative of their testimony . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
motion agreed to and bill read second time . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , when shall this bill be read the third time ? 
on motion of Senator Cools , bill placed on the Orders of the Day for third reading at the next sitting of the Senate . 
official Languages Commissioner 
motion on Appointment Adopted 
hon. Sharon Carstairs , pursuant to notice of December 7 , 1998 , moved : 
honourable senators , Mr. Victor Goldbloom ' s term will expire on December 23 , 1998 , and I wish to begin my remarks today by first extending to Mr. Goldbloom , on behalf of this chamber , and I believe on behalf of all Canadians , appreciation for his many years of commitment and dedicated service . 
the Commissioner of Official Languages is a special ombudsperson who reports directly to Parliament . 
the commissioner is responsible for protecting and promoting the linguistic rights of individuals and groups in Canada and for monitoring the linguistic performance of federal institutions and other organizations governed by the Official Languages Act . 
the commissioner investigates complaints and makes recommendations so that the linguistic rights of Canadians in their dealings with federal institutions are respected . 
the role of the commissioner is clearly focused on people . 
the commissioner meets regularly with Canadians of all ages and conditions in every province , working with them to enhance respect for our two official languages . 
the commissioner also meets with officials from the various orders of governments , and individuals from the private community and academic sectors . 
the commissioner also plays an important role in assisting official language minority communities in developing and enhancing their vitality and obtaining the rights guaranteed them by the Constitution and the Official Languages Act . 
madam Dyane Adam clearly possesses the skills , background and experience to fulfil the responsibilities of this position . 
over the years , Dr. Adam has helped launch numerous provincial and regional organizations and projects for the francophones and women of Ontario and of Quebec . 
she has been promoting and defending our two official languages for a long time . 
she founded the R é seau des chercheures f é ministes de l ' Ontario fran ç ais and belongs to a number of organizations , including the Consortium des universit é s de la francophonie ontarienne . 
she served for three years as chair of the Advisory Committee on Francophone Affairs with the Ontario Ministry of Education and Training . 
members of the Joint Committee on Official Languages recently had the opportunity to meet with Madam Adam to discuss her qualifications for this position . 
point of Order 
hon. No ë l Kinsella ( Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I rise on a point of order . 
i believe that there is a provision in the rules that addresses given in this chamber may not be taken from the Hansard of the other place . 
Randy White then spoke , and perhaps one of us could read his speech . 
Suzanne Tremblay then spoke , and I suppose I could try to get Senator Lynch - Staunton to read that . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
god forbid ! 
senator Kinsella : 
perhaps His Honour could give us some guidance on that point . 
hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
all I can say , honourable senators , is that this does not come from a copy of the Hansard . 
this comes from speaking notes that were given to me . 
i assumed they were original speaking notes when I made the presentation this afternoon , and I deeply regret if , in fact , they have been taken directly from the announcement in the other place . 
senator Kinsella : 
i accept the deputy leader ' s explanation . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , under the circumstances , with the explanation from the Deputy Leader of the Government , it seems that indeed speaking notes may have been prepared by the same person and may be identical , but there is no indication that it is a quotation from the other place , so Senator Carstairs may carry on . 
senator Carstairs : 
thank you , honourable senators . 
let me assure all honourable senators that , in future , I will make sure I have original speaking notes . 
as I said earlier , Mr. Goldbloom has agreed to serve in the interim , subject to consultation by the Prime Minister with the Speaker of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Commons . 
i would therefore call on all honourable senators to support the adoption of this motion . 
hon. G é rald - A . 
honourable senators , last week in the Official Languages Committee we heard Dr. Dyane Adam , who has just been appointed by the government as Commissioner of Official Languages . 
i had the opportunity to ask Dr. Adam a number of questions on the scope and the role of the Official Languages Act , and on her publications , which are numerous , impressively so . 
this is a position of the highest importance . 
the responses given by Dr. Dyane Adam , her writings , her actions , her academic background , speak for themselves . 
the selection strikes me as an excellent one . 
i therefore take pleasure in inviting all of my colleagues to approve the appointment of Dr. Dyane Adam as Commissioner of Official Languages for Canada for a term of seven years . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , are there any other senators who wish to speak ? 
some Hon. Senators : 
No. 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
it has been moved by the Honourable Senator Carstairs , and seconded by Senator Joyal , that in accordance with subsections 49 ( 1 ) and 49 ( 2 ) of the Act respecting the status and use of the Official Languages of Canada , Chapter O - 3.01 of the Revised Statutes of Canada , 1985 , this house approves the appointment of Dr. Dyane Adam as Commissioner of Official Languages for Canada for a term of seven years . 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
motion agreed to . 
DNA Identification Bill 
report of Committee 
leave having been given to revert to Reports of Committees : 
hon. Lorna Milne , Chair of the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs , presented the following report : 
Tuesday , December 8 , 1998 
the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has the honour to present its 
sixteenth REPORT 
your Committee , to which was referred Bill C - 3 , An Act respecting DNA identification and to make consequential amendments to the Criminal Code and other Acts , has , in obedience to the Order of Reference of Thursday , October 22 , 1998 , examined the said Bill and now reports the same without amendment . 
however , your Committee received the following undertakings from the Solicitor General and his officials , including the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police : 
the Solicitor General will , during the anticipated 18 - month hiatus between Royal Assent and the coming into force of Bill C - 3 , proceed with a new bill that will bring within the ambit of the DNA data bank those offenders who are convicted in the military justice system ; 
the new bill will also give Senate and House of Commons committees the same authority to conduct the five - year review required under Bill C - 3 ; 
your Committee urges the Solicitor General to include the appointment of the advisory committee in regulations to the Act ; 
the Solicitor General agreed that the regulations to Bill C - 3 would be prepublished and available to the Senate for comment and evaluation ; 
the Commissioner of the RCMP undertook to include a report on the operation of the DNA data bank as part of his annual report to the Minister which would then be tabled in Parliament ; 
officials from the Department of the Solicitor General also agreed to clarify in regulations that what is meant by " DNA profile " is " not a profile for medical reasons , " but for law enforcement purposes only . 
this would address your Committee ' s concern that forensic DNA analysis utilise only those markers that do not predict any medical , physical or mental characteristics , in order to protect the genetic privacy of those individuals included in the data bank ; 
in response to your Committee ' s concern about the highly sensitive nature of the information contained within the data bank and the rapidity of technological change , the Solicitor General agreed to consider including within the proposed new bill , provision for parliamentary review every five years . 
your Committee recognizes the pressing need for a national DNA data bank that will enable Canadian law enforcement agencies to make full use of recent technological advances for the benefit of enhanced public safety . 
your Committee welcomes the undertakings made in the course of these hearings and recognizes that they will substantially address many of the concerns raised by Committee members . 
a copy of a letter from the Solicitor General to the Chair of your Committee , dated December 1 , 1998 , is appended to this report . 
respectfully submitted , 
LORNA MILNE

hon. Jerahmiel S . Grafstein : 
honourable senators , I know that this is highly out of order but , with leave of the Senate , I wish to take a few moments to describe the formulation of this report . 
it is highly unusual because the report was made without amendment , but some unusual facts surround this report . 
with leave of my colleagues on the other side , I will address this report for a few minutes . 
hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I believe there is agreement to do so , but later this day . 
hon. John Lynch - Staunton ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , we must follow some basic rules . 
the rules provide that there is no debate on a report that is submitted without amendment . 
we then proceed immediately to third reading where there is opportunity for debate . 
i do not know why we need to make an exception here . 
we have a heavy agenda in front of us and a lot of inquiries on which our colleagues wish to speak . 
the honourable senator is asking for leave to do something that can be done tomorrow and something for which I do not see any urgency . 
i cannot be persuaded that we should give leave on this matter . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
leave is not granted . 
honourable senators , when shall this bill be read the third time ? 
on motion of Senator Milne , bill placed on the Orders of the Day for third reading at the next sitting of the Senate . 
private Bill 
the Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Mackenzie - Bill to Amend - Report of Committee Adopted 
the Senate proceeded to consideration of the fourteenth report of the Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs , Science and Technology ( Bill S - 20 , to amend the Act of incorporation of the Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Mackenzie , with amendments ) presented in the Senate on December 3 , 1998 . 
hon. Nicholas W . Taylor : 
honourable senators , I move the adoption of the report . 
motion agreed to and report adopted . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , when shall the bill be read the third time ? 
on motion of Senator Taylor , bill placed on the Orders of the Day for third reading at the next sitting of the Senate . 
royal Assent Bill 
consideration of Report of Committee - Motion in Amendment - Speaker ' s Ruling - Order Withdrawn 
on the Order : 
resuming debate on the motion of the Honourable Senator Milne , seconded by the Honourable Senator Bryden , for the adoption of the Twelfth Report of the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs ( Bill S - 15 , An Act respecting the declaration of royal assent by the Governor General in the Queen ' s name to bills passed by the Houses of Parliament , with amendments ) presented in the Senate on June 18 , 1998 , 
and on the motion in amendment of the Honourable Senator Grafstein , seconded by the Honourable Senator P é pin , that the Report be not now adopted , but that it be referred back to the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for further consideration . 
- ( speaker ' s Ruling ) . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , I am prepared to make my ruling now on this order , which was standing in my name . 
honourable senators , last Tuesday , December 1 , during debate on the motion to adopt the twelfth report of the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs respecting Bill S - 15 ; and the motion in amendment of Senator Grafstein , Senator Lynch - Staunton sought leave to withdraw the bill . 
in making his request , he expressed some reservation about his right to do so . 
for my part , I , too , had certain doubts about the acceptability of the request given that the Senate was debating the report on the bill rather than the bill itself . 
senator Kinsella correctly pointed to the novel aspects of this proceeding . 
subsequently , I agreed to take the matter under advisement . 
after considering the relevance of the request by Senator Lynch - Staunton on procedure , I am now prepared to give my decision . 
rule 30 permits a senator moving a motion or making an inquiry to withdraw or modify same with leave of the Senate . 
it seems therefore that Senator Lynch - Staunton is entitled to this request . 
Erskine May ( 22 nd edition at page 467 ) states that a bill introduced into the House of Lords may - with the unanimous consent of the House - be withdrawn by the lord presenting it at any time after first reading . 
in this particular case , what we are dealing with now is the report of the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and the amendment of Senator Grafstein to refer the bill back to the committee . 
bill S - 15 is not actually before the Senate for debate . 
as I understand it then , it would be necessary to dispose of Senator Grafstein ' s amendment and the report before the Senate would be debating the bill . 
until that happens , I do not believe that Senator Lynch - Staunton is entitled to make a request to withdraw the bill . 
debate on the amendment of Senator Grafstein can now resume . 
hon. Jerahmiel S . Grafstein : 
honourable senators , if it remains the wish of Senator Lynch - Staunton to withdraw this bill , I will not provide any barriers to his proceeding in this fashion . 
therefore , I would be glad to withdraw my amendment to make a navigable path for the Leader of the Opposition to withdraw his bill . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
is it agreed , honourable senators , to allow honourable Senator Grafstein to withdraw his amendment ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I suggest that we withdraw the report of the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , is it agreed that the report be discharged at this time ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
the report is discharged and the bill is now before the Senate . 
hon. John Lynch - Staunton ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , in the mode of withdrawal , I will not break the pattern . 
i thank Senator Grafstein for his courtesy . 
i will not argue the merits of the bill except to say that I was afraid that , with Senator Grafstein ' s well - intentioned interest in the bill and from what I read of his remarks , it might have lost its original purpose . 
therefore , rather than burden the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs with additional work , I felt it was preferable to ask that the bill be withdrawn . 
during the recess , I shall try to develop a new draft to present as soon as we return which I hope will address the concerns that were raised here and in committee . 
the principle of the bill is supported by the government , the Governor General ' s office and the Supreme Court . 
it has overwhelming support elsewhere . 
the traditional ceremony would remain . 
without again returning to the debate we had in June , we are the only Commonwealth country which persists in keeping the traditional Royal Assent ceremony . 
the United Kingdom is now moving to abolish heredity peers . 
even when Her Majesty the Queen opened Parliament last month , she had fewer attendants than before . 
in Canada we will be changing the oath of allegiance . 
new Canadians will no longer swear allegiance to Her Majesty , successors and heirs . 
i do not think we should be too rigidly disciplined by traditions , some of which are not Canadian traditions . 
i hope that the bill I present in February will allay some of the apprehensions that Senator Grafstein and others have expressed . 
again , I thank Senator Grafstein for allowing the bill to be withdrawn . 
i hope that what will be presented in February will meet with his approval . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , is leave granted for Honourable Senator Lynch - Staunton to withdraw the bill ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
motion agreed to and order withdrawn . 
official Languages Act 
progressive Deterioration of French Services Available to Francophones Outside of Quebec - Inquiry - Debate Adjourned 
on the Order : 
hon. G é rald - A . 
honourable senators , the Official Languages Act was an important event in the history of Canadian federalism . 
it was a turning point . 
this Act was the product of the Laurendeau - Dunton commission . 
three prime ministers invested particular effort in it : 
this is a good measure which does much to promote better cooperation and better relations between the various groups that make up Canadian society . 
i wish to draw the attention of my colleagues to the fact that the two official languages enjoy equality of status , and to the issue of delegation . 
we must remember that section 2 of the act provides that French and English enjoy equality of status at the federal level . 
while section 133 of the Constitution Act , 1867 is very useful and significant , it is just an embryo of bilingualism . 
the act of 1968 - 69 and that of 1988 complete the picture . 
i draw your attention to the equal status of the two official languages . 
of course , we all know that there are fewer francophones than anglophones in our country . 
nevertheless , the two official languages enjoy equal status under the Constitution . 
canada ' s political and legal framework is thus changed . 
the second point concerns the powers that the federal authority can delegate to the provinces and municipalities in the area of contraventions , to which my colleague Senator Losier - Cool alluded in her excellent speech . 
this is not an interparliamentary legislative delegation which , as we know , is prohibited under case law , but an administrative delegation . 
under the 1982 Contravention Act , the federal Minister of Justice has the power to sign agreements with the provinces or the municipal or local authorities , to allow them to prosecute people for violations of federal acts . 
i do not oppose such delegation , provided the Official Languages Act continues to be complied with . 
a few days ago , I explained to the Standing Joint Committee on Official Languages that if a federal delegation is made , we must at least make sure that the political entity receiving delegated powers will be as bilingual as the delegating authority . 
indeed , the Parliament of Canada and the federal government must be bilingual under the Official Languages Act , and they make great efforts to implement bilingualism . 
the same cannot be said of the legislative authorities receiving delegated powers . 
not all of them are subject to the same institutional bilingualism requirements as some provinces . 
i believe it is not too much to ask that , when taking over federal responsibilities under the terms of an agreement , they should also , like the federal government , abide by the bilingualism requirement . 
arrangements may have to be made that will make us incur additional expenditures . 
this will be money well spent . 
it is in keeping with the spirit of the Official Languages Act . 
the Association des juristes d ' expression fran ç aise de l ' Ontario was right to suggest that the Contraventions Act should be amended to include a guarantee that linguistic rights will be maintained should the provinces or their municipalities take over proceedings for contraventions to the laws of Canada . 
a brief comment , in closing , on Part VII of the Official Languages Act . 
i have always been in favour of implementing this important part of the Official Languages Act , dealing with the promotion of both French and English . 
section 41 reads as follows : 
the Government of Canada is committed to enhancing the vitality of the English and French linguistic minority communities in Canada and supporting and assisting their development ; and fostering the full recognition and use of both English and French in Canadian society . 
it is not enough to state that our two official languages are on an equal footing in federal jurisdictions . 
we must take this a step further by actually promoting both official languages . 
to those who object for financial reasons , we say that few expenditures in Canada represent as good an investment in the future of Canada as whatever is spent on official languages . 
on motion of Senator Corbin , debate adjourned . 
united Nations 
international Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights - Recent Responses to Questions from Committee - Inquiry - Debate Continued 
on the Order : 
resuming debate on the inquiry of the Honourable Senator Kinsella calling the attention of the Senate to the Responses to the Supplementary Questions emitted by the United Nations Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights on Canada ' s Third Report on the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights . - ( 
honourable Senator Cohen ) . 
hon. Erminie J . Cohen : 
honourable senators , I rise today to resume debate on the inquiry made by my colleague Senator Kinsella on November 24 calling the attention of the Senate to the recent meetings held in Geneva examining Canada ' s level of compliance under the obligations we assumed in 1976 by signing the Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights . 
the National Anti - Poverty Organization , along with several other non - governmental organizations , travelled to Geneva to take part in this examination and were allowed 10 minutes for their report on Canada ' s compliance with the convention . 
unfortunately , their time was shortened to three minutes . 
i have the full presentation . 
i should like to read it into the record . 
since the UN gave Canada a failing grade last Friday and criticized our record of protecting the economic , cultural and social rights of our citizens , it is fitting that we hear these words from the report of the National Anti - Poverty Association since the rising level of homelessness and poverty in Canada was a major issue for the committee . 
honourable senators , the following is the oral presentation to the UN Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights given in Geneva by the National Anti - Poverty Organization on November 16 , 1998 : 
the National Anti - Poverty Organization ( NAPO ) is a national , non - profit , non - partisan organization representing the 5.2 million Canadians currently living below the poverty line . 
NAPO has approximately 3,000 members - including 700 groups . 
our report will focus primarily on the impact of government measures on economic and social conditions in Canada and the resulting loss of economic and social rights . 
the frayed social safety net of 1998 bears little resemblance to the social security system that had been in place since the 1960 s . 
i will not be limiting my remarks to the original period of the review ( that is , ending in September 1994 ) , but will include those fundamental changes that have occurred in recent years to both federal and provincial social security programs - including welfare , unemployment insurance and the increasing atmosphere of intolerance for poor people in Canada . 
these changes have invariably involved decreases in the quality and quantity of services available . 
in some jurisdictions , the changes have been so severe that the most vulnerable people are having difficulty obtaining adequate food and shelter . 
since 1993 , when this Committee expressed concern about Canada ' s inability to reduce poverty , the Canadian people have witnessed a further collapse of the social safety net and the government has yet to establish a serious strategy to eradicate poverty . 
in fact , due in large part to extreme measures taken by both federal and provincial governments in the name of debt and deficit reduction , the past five years have seen the most dramatic reversal of social and economic equalization initiatives since Canada ' s social security system was set up over thirty years ago . 
one of the most profound changes to Canada ' s social security framework came with the elimination of the Canada Assistance Plan ( CAP ) and the implementation of the Canada Health and Social Transfer in 1996 . 
with the repeal of CAP , these standards no longer exist . 
with the introduction of the CHST , the federal government also significantly reduced its financial support for social programs . 
in real per capita terms , federal cash transfers to the provinces for welfare , health and post - secondary education fell by more than 40 per cent between 1993 - 1997 . 
regarding welfare : 
in March 1997 , there were an estimated 2.7 million people receiving welfare in Canada - and approximately 1.1 million were children . 
social assistance levels vary widely between provinces , but virtually all are woefully inadequate . 
in Newfoundland , for example , a single employable person receives a mere 19 per cent of the Low Income Cut Off ( LICO ) , while in the Northwest Territories , she / he would receive 76 per cent . 
recent statistics collected by the Canadian Association of Food Banks shows that approximately three - quarters of households using food banks receive income from social assistance . 
provincial governments have engaged in actions that promote a growing intolerance for social assistance recipients - from increased policing measures to stem the " flood " of welfare fraud ( which in reality sits at about 4 per cent and in many jurisdictions includes administrative error ) to blaming the poor for their poverty and being the cause of high government debts and deficits . 
there is now an identifiable division between " deserving " and " undeserving " poor in Canada . 
the " deserving " poor includes only the disabled , sometimes single parents with young children but mostly the working poor . 
pioneered by the Province of British Columbia in 1996 , and introduced to the whole country in 1998 , the National Child Benefit ( NCB ) purports to address the problem of child poverty in Canada . 
although the benefits go to all children in low income families , the only actual beneficiaries of the NCB are working poor families since the provinces are allowed to deduct the full amount of the increased federal benefit from families on welfare . 
only two provinces , Newfoundland and New Brunswick , have chosen to allow welfare families to keep this money . 
in the end , this means that of the 1.5 million children living in poor families in Canada , approximately 1.1 million receive no benefit from this program . 
regarding employment insurance : 
the right of Canadians to social security , including social insurance , has been weakened by a series of cuts that were made to the Employment Insurance program between 1993 and 1997 . 
by 1998 , restricted eligibility requirements and lower benefit levels have led to increasing annual surpluses . 
by the end of 1998 , the Employment Insurance fund is expected to exceed $ 20 billion . 
the government intends to use this surplus to reduce government debt and to allow for some small tax decreases . 
the changes to the Employment Insurance program have taken several forms . 
the shift from using the number of weeks worked to determine eligibility to using the number of hours worked has meant that workers must work longer to be eligible . 
it also means that someone can be denied benefits because they are a half hour short - as happened in Victoria recently to a woman who was denied maternity benefits . 
employment Insurance benefits have been reduced in amount and duration so that today ' s rates are 5 per cent less than they were in 1991 and the benefit period is nearly half that of the 1980 s . 
perhaps most profound has been the combined effect of longer eligibility requirements and increased grounds for disallowance . 
the 45 per cent of workers who no longer qualify for Employment Insurance benefits - when faced with unemployment - now must rely on inadequate provincial and territorial welfare systems . 
regarding intolerance for the poor : 
in 1993 , following Canada ' s second periodic review , the Committee recommended that Canadian human rights legislation include more explicit reference to economic , social and cultural rights . 
the government of Canada has failed to act on this recommendation . 
at the same time , the atmosphere of intolerance for and prejudice against poor Canadians has grown . 
it has become socially acceptable to openly abuse and malign poor people . 
many , including governments , public utilities , financial institutions and landlords , choose to deal with their discomfort about the growing number of poor people by denying or minimizing the reality of poverty or asserting that poor people - not government choices and economic forces - are the cause of their own poverty . 
human rights protection is the first important step in both reversing these trends and beginning to provide an environment conducive to full economic and social participation by all Canadians . 
canada ' s government shows no interest in doing so although the majority of provincial governments have some sort of protection in their human rights codes for those on welfare . 
and now for a few quick facts : 
the use of food banks doubled from 1989 to 1997 . 
in March 1998 , 162,496 people received food from food banks . 
2 . The average debt load of a student graduating with a bachelor ' s degree is $ 25,000 . 
3 . 1.7 million Canadians - or 43 per cent of all renters - paid more than 30 per cent of household income on shelter . 
by conservative measure , there are over 200,000 Canadians who are homeless . 
6 . The cities of Toronto and Ottawa have supported a call by social agencies to have homelessness declared a national emergency . 
conclusion : 
the cancellation of the Canada Assistance Plan in April 1996 has had profoundly negative effects on poor Canadians . 
NAPO would suggest that the Committee propose the following changes to Canada . 
enact legislation that confirms the unconditional right for all Canadians to receive financial assistance from government if they are in need . 
2 . Support the passage of Bill S - 11 to amend the Human Rights Act to include " social condition " as one of the prohibited grounds of discrimination . 
3 . Improve the Employment Insurance program so that it reduces the financial insecurity of Canadians ( struggling in the new labour market ) to ensure benefits are available to all who are in need . 
4 . Develop a concrete plan of action ( that does not rely on growth from private sector investment ) to eliminate poverty , homelessness and the need for food banks . 
thank you . 
this concludes their presentation . 
it should be reassuring to honourable senators to note that in this report NAPO included a recommendation to pass Bill S - 11 as an important step to advance the rights of the poor , something which this chamber has already unanimously agreed to do . 
as my colleague Senator Kinsella pointed out when introducing the inquiry , we in the Senate seem to be quite a few miles ahead of the government on that particular front . 
allow me to congratulate the two NAPO presenters who did an excellent job illustrating how difficult life has become for Canada ' s poor . 
one of the presenters , Pam Coates , President of NAPO , is from my home city of Saint John , New Brunswick . 
to quote the New Brunswick Telegraph Journal : 
the UN Committee heard this anti - poverty activist loud and clear on Canada ' s shabby treatment of its poor citizens . 
honourable senators , it is my hope that 1999 will see many social policy changes so that we will improve the living conditions of Canada ' s poor . 
on motion of Senator DeWare , debate adjourned . 
solicitor General 
commission of Inquiry into Treatment of Protestors at APEC Conference by RCMP - Provision of Funds for Defence of Students - Motion - Debate Continued 
on the Order : 
resuming debate on the motion of the Honourable Senator Carney , P . C . , seconded by the Honourable Senator Bolduc : 
that the Senate supports the granting of funding for legal counsel to complainants at the APEC hearing in Vancouver before the RCMP Public Complaints Commission . - 
( honourable Senator Graham , P . C . ) . 
hon. Marjory LeBreton : 
honourable senators , I wish to speak to the motion moved by my colleague Senator Carney which deals with the rights of Canadians to be accorded the full benefit of Canadian citizenship . 
once again Canadians are faced with a situation which is cause for concern , or should be . 
the issues surrounding the APEC controversy go straight to the heart of what Canadians value : freedom of speech , freedom of assembly , the right to peaceful protest , respect for our people and institutions , and individual rights and freedoms . 
all of these proud Canadian traditions were swept aside by the Prime Minister , his office and his collaborators in government . 
does no one on the government side have the courage to speak out ? 
are they willing conspirators in thwarting the rights of our citizens and the rights of Parliament ? 
by way of chronology , the following is a matter of record with regard to the political role of the foreign affairs section of the PMO in the APEC affair . 
time does not permit the full chronology , but the following will give us a good idea of what transpired . 
July 18 , 1997 - in a memo from the Canadian Ambassador to Indonesia , Gary Smith : 
anti - Suharto " wanted " posters put up in various Canadian cities have become a topic of intense diplomatic discussion at the highest level . 
July 30 , 1997 - in a memo reporting on a meeting between Minister of Foreign Affairs Lloyd Axworthy and Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas : 
Alatas said " ... if it caused concern to Canadian government because agitation of these groups could not be controlled and dignity of President [ Suharto ] was sullied , the President would rather not come to Canada . " 
the minister [ Axworthy ] said he apologized for the poster campaign . 
august 11 , 1997 - draft text for Letter from Lloyd Axworthy to his Indonesian counterpart : 
with respect to security arrangements for the APEC Economic Leaders Meeting ... you have my assurance that the interests / concerns of the Indonesian government will be given the utmost consideration .... Security 
august 27 , 1997 - notes of RCMP Superintendent Wayne May : 
PM specific wish that this is a retreat and leaders should not be distracted by demos , et cetera . 
august 27 , 1997 - e - mail from RCMP Inspector Bill Dingwall to Superintendent May : 
jean Carle does not want the demonstrators close at all ! 
September 3 , 1997 - Lloyd Axworthy ' s letter to Minister Ali Alatas - which was strengthened from the suggested draft : 
i have conveyed the security concerns of President Suharto to Prime Minister Chr é tien . 
i can assure you that [ demonstrators ] will not be permitted in close proximity to the President . 
jean Carle ( PMO Director of Operations ) and Robert ' s ( Vanderloo ) request to have demonstrators pushed back a bit further than originally planned ... 
in addition , Robert is considering placing plants / trees at the foot of Gate 4 so that when the leaders depart they will be surrounded by trees , et cetera ( aesthetically pleasing . ) 
this also helps with the sight lines . 
September 12 , 1997 - another e - mail from Inspector Dingwall to Constable Don Merkel regarding coverings to block sight lines : 
on the same date : 
September 12 , 1997 - in a note regarding the delivery of Axworthy ' s Letter on AELM security measures , it is reported that the letter does - 
... address both the physical security and " proximity " concerns - 
September 19 , 1997 - a memorandum was prepared for the Prime Minister and was accompanied by talking points : 
ambassador Parwoto [ Indonesia ' s Ambassador to Canada ] is apparently skeptical about the degree to which Canada is prepared to take action to avoid embarrassment to President Suharto . 
your meeting with him will serve as an important opportunity to underline the importance Canada attaches , at the highest levels , to President Suharto ' s attendance and the seriousness with which it intends to address his physical security in Vancouver . 
please convey to the President my [ Chr é tien ' s ] intention to telephone him personally in the coming days to discuss his participation in the Vancouver APEC Leaders ' Meeting . 
canada will be taking particular care to ensure the President ' s stay is a pleasant and rewarding one . 
his personal security is assured , and steps will be taken to preserve his comfort . 
October 1 , 1997 - in a memorandum for the PM regarding his invitation letters to APEC leaders : 
your letter to Indonesia ' s President Suharto contains additional language acknowledging his personal concerns and stressing your determination that all arrangements will be taken to ensure an uneventful stay in Vancouver . 
October 3 , 1997 - a letter from Jean Chr é tien to Suharto : 
i understand you have had discussions with my Minister of Foreign Affairs on the arrangements for the Vancouver meetings . 
i have directed my officials to spare no effort to ensure that appropriate security and other arrangements are made for your stay in Canada as our guest . 
October 9 , 1997 - a memorandum from Ambassador Smith regarding the delivery of the PM ' s letter it is reported : 
the President therefore has decided to attend . 
step one has been achieved . 
now we have to turn our attention to ensuring that he gets back without too much difficulty . 
October 21 , 1997 - a memorandum from RCMP Corporal Peter Koleyak to S / Sgt. 
Peter Montague [ Security Liaison to Indonesia ] : 
the ambassador ... wanted me to assure him that he could tell his President that things were under control and there would be no reason for concern regarding embarrassing incidents and that the President would not see any major demonstrations ... I 
if they hang banners towards the MoA [ Museum of Anthropology - the site of the Leaders ' Summit ] , are they going to be visible through the trees ? 
could we erect some sort of draping to cut off the view ? 
who is looking after that ? 
if they are not going to be permitted , what is the authority for removing them and who is going to do it ? 
November 20 th - e - mail from Inspector Dingwall to Superintendent May : 
Robert Vanderloo advised who in turn advised PMO - who are very concerned . 
tomorrow # 1 - 
i assume that is the Prime Minister . 
- had planned to tour several sites and this may be affected ... We 
will also need to examine options of limiting media coverage should the decision be made to remove them ... ( during the quiet hours , moving in buses , moving media back , et cetera . ) 
on November 21 various RCMP notes reveal the following : 
the PM directs the RCMP to arrest members of APEC Alert who are peacefully camped out at the site of the Leaders ' Summit . 
various " economies " are scheduled to tour the site in the next few days . 
the PM himself is scheduled to visit the site on the 21 st . 
various other documents show that the APEC Threat Assessment Group ( TAG ) and RCMP do not believe that the students pose any threat to the site . 
PM " wants the tenters out . " 
PM says leave them until 6 pm . 
PM wanted everyone removed . 
November 21 , 1997 - Memo from Chris Brown ( APEC - UBC Liaison ) to UBC President Piper : 
the Federal Government threatens the University that they will take over the Summit site prior to the agreed date in order to arrest the students camping there . 
on the 20 th , the PM cancelled a signing ceremony at UBC with the Australian PM in order to put pressure on the University . 
the University capitulates , and hands the site over to the Government . 
six students are arrested on the 22 nd and 23 rd and charged with mischief . 
they are not released from jail until they sign a set of conditions which include " I will not participate or be found in attendance at any public demonstration or rally that has gathered together for the sole purpose of demonstrating against the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation or against any nation participating in the so named conference . " 
December 3 , 1997 - a note to Superintendent Thompsett states the following : 
the night before the Leader ' s Summit , the tent city located at the University of British Columbia included over 80 tents , with 100 - 200 people sleeping inside the occupied Student Union Building . 
on November 25 th , the day of the Leader ' s Retreat , approximately 3,000 people rally outside the Goddess of Democracy statue and then march to the Summit . 
during the various protests , students are arrested for being protest organizers , " saying foolish things , " holding signs , walkie - talkies or megaphones . 
students involved in civil - disobedience are pepper - sprayed rather than being arrested , and students blocking one of the three motorcade exits are pepper - sprayed out of the way without warning . 
almost all the woman arrested are strip - searched and some have " cavity searches . " 
in all , 78 APEC related arrests are made at UBC in the weeks surrounding the Summit . 
the writer then concludes : 
my recommendation is to never hold an APEC event at a University . 
the final statement in the chronology entitled , " Post - APEC - RCMP Q & A ' s for media " makes the following interesting comment : 
the Prime Minister ' s Office was not involved in RCMP security arrangements . 
there you have it , honourable senators - undeniable interference and obsessive political involvement . 
we have many examples of a government out of control - a government that will not tolerate opposition or dissent . 
the fingerprints of the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister ' s Office are all over the aforementioned and now they would have us believe , in the case of the APEC , that there is a place , a vehicle , the Public Complaints Commission , to get to the bottom of the APEC / Peppergate / Save - a - Dictator affair . 
as further proof of their inability to tolerate dissent , look no further than the actions of the Prime Minister ' s Director of Communications , Mr. Peter Donolo , against the CBC ' s Terry Milewski . 
there is an odd contradiction here , would you not agree , honourable senators ? 
on the one hand , the government ' s first line of defence on the indiscretions of Andy Scott was to blame MP Dick Proctor for having ears . 
" Snooping , " the Prime Minister called it . 
they kept this up for days and days . 
" how dare you snoop on a private conversation ? " 
they said . 
then what did they do ? 
they eavesdropped , by way of the Internet , on a private conversation between the CBC ' s Milewski and Craig Jones . 
it was a handy diversionary tactic , something they often do . 
get the heat off themselves ; more muddle , more confusion : all very convenient . 
now the Public Complaints Commission sits in limbo . 
all this suits the Prime Minister and the PMO very well . 
let us make one thing very clear : 
the Public Complaints Commission , if it ever does get up and running , does not have the mandate to get to the bottom of the role of the Prime Minister , the Prime Minister ' s Office , or other members of the government , as I have outlined in my chronology . 
surely this is what is owed to the public to whom we are all accountable . 
how can any party which claims to believe in parliamentary democracy refuse to agree to such a reasonable course of action ? 
to refuse , I am afraid to say , is an admission of guilt , an attempt to avoid scrutiny . 
i will close by quoting from a CBC commentary on October 5 , 1998 . This commentary was provided by Dr. John Dixon of the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association , which the government seems to be very anxious to quote these days . 
it is particularly crisp in its presentation of the constitutional ramifications of ignoring this important issue . 
the following text is taken verbatim ; these are the words of Dr. John Dixon : 
the APEC story runs , as the journalists say , on two very long legs . 
one of them is the iconographic image of a fifty - something RCMP officer going nuts with a party - pak of pepper spray . 
Dats some ting dat I put on my plate . " 
there ' s a heavy dotted line connecting these images , with a big question mark on it . 
or maybe five or six question marks . 
sorting out all the strands connecting the Prime Minister ' s Office and the disastrous RCMP performance at APEC is going to provide lots and lots of fun - spectator and otherwise . 
eventually , however , even the longest legs get run off a story like this . 
our media need constant movement , drama , speed , and - first , last , and always - powerful visuals . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
i am sorry , senator , but the 15 - minute time period is up . 
senator LeBreton : 
i have only one more page to go , honourable senators . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
thank you . 
commission and court hearings run very short on these commodities , and without them a mass audience starts to fade . 
i point this out not to depress , but to put us all on alert . 
because the heart of the APEC story , quite apart from its great legs , is about nothing less than democracy ' s one true thing , and it would be tragic for us to lose interest in it . 
that " one true thing " is that it is not the political parties in power , not the mandarins in the public service , not the police , and not the judiciary , who are sovereign in Canada . 
it is the Canadian People who form the sovereign branch of their own government , and in whom reside the ultimate source of all legitimate political power and authority . 
flowing from this fundamental fact of democratic life is the great free speech corollary that when the people come together to confer or discuss or argue or demonstrate about any matter of political importance , no inferior branch of their government may interfere with them . 
this is the great issue that the commission hearings and the lawsuits must struggle to bring into focus - and then keep in focus - for Canadians and their legal culture . 
in aid of this struggle , I propose that we have a plan - like all good Canucks who realize that we must travel far by snow in the deepening cold . 
when we find the inevitable APEC fatigue starting to set in , we have to be ready to give ourselves a good pinch to keep from lying down in the snow . 
so put these words on your fridge door now : 
if YOU ' RE TIRED OF APEC , YOU ' RE TIRED OF JUSTICE AND DEMOCRACY . 
on motion of Senator P é pin , debate adjourned . 
universal Declaration of Human Rights 
commemoration of Fiftieth Anniversary - Inquiry - Debate Continued 
on the Order : 
resuming debate on the inquiry of the Honourable Senator Wilson calling the attention of the Senate to the fiftieth anniversary year of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , and its implications for Canada . - 
( honourable Senator Carstairs ) . 
hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , I welcome the opportunity that Senator Wilson has given us to speak to the fiftieth anniversary year of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its implications for Canada . 
i would also like to share some observations for your deliberation . 
the preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , adopted and proclaimed by the General Assembly on December 10 , 1948 , states : 
whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom , justice and peace in the world , 
it goes on to say : 
whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind , and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people , 
the declaration further goes on to state : 
... the GENERAL ASSEMBLY proclaims THIS UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations , to the end that every individual and every organ of society , keeping this Declaration constantly in mind , shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms and by progressive measures , national and international , to secure their universal and effective recognition and observance , both among the peoples of Member States themselves and among the peoples of territories under their jurisdiction . 
it is therefore worthy to note that the rights and freedoms are for all people , irrespective of where they live . 
states are recognized as member states by joining the United Nations . 
by doing so , they are obliged to adhere to this declaration , and therefore , no state is exempt of its obligation and no peoples should be deprived of the rights within the declaration . 
it is deplorable that sovereignty is allowed to excuse nations , allowing barbarous acts and cruel and inhumane treatment of citizens by nation states . 
the implication for Canada , therefore , is that every individual , and the government in particular , must ensure that our laws , practices and actions are consistent with the spirit and the letter of the universal declaration . 
canada has also a responsibility to ensure that other countries , once members of the United Nations and signatories to the covenants , carry out their responsibilities . 
the United Nations is so structured that review mechanisms and implementation mechanisms are built into the follow - up to attempt to implement these words into actions and compliances . 
canada has had a history , since the inception of the declaration , of scrupulously adhering to the declaration and being open to criticism when we were found wanting . 
we have used this in diplomacy to our advantage to indicate that there is no country , including ours , that could be smug about its own record . 
it is only when there is openness , frankness and willingness to adhere to international laws that these international laws will take hold . 
therefore , Canada must again reassert its position to be equally transparent with the bodies that scrutinize us in Canada on behalf of all of us , as is our responsibility . 
it is with regret that I note that of late Canada has acted at times cavalierly and sometimes less than forthrightly in its response to scrutiny by international bodies . 
when Canada was called on to defend its human rights records before the UN Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights as early as November 1997 , it was reported that Canada ' s charg é d ' affaires at the UN in Geneva , Andrew McAlistair informed the head of the committee that " Canada is not prepared to appear before the committee next spring . " 
further , it would appear that Canada ' s response , when it finally came , painted a picture that was more glowing than worthy of our real position . 
we have heard from Senator Cohen and from Senator Kinsella previously on the lack of forthrightness in our position . 
it is obvious that the Canadian government , while properly pointing out our accomplishments , did not balance the report with a realistic picture of our shortcomings on aboriginal issues , poverty , the plight of single mothers and their families and the homeless , to name just some of the issues . 
it left no room but to elicit from the UN Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights a strong rebuke of Canada ' s human rights record , citing the shortcomings as shocking in a developed country . 
i urge all honourable senators to read that report . 
another sign of deterioration in Canada ' s commitment is that , although we espouse support and supremacy of international law , passing the Coastal Fisheries Act , a domestic law passed in 1994 , and using the " reservation " mechanism to preclude the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice is not consistent with our continuing support for the supremacy of international law . 
we put Madam Justice Arbour in her position in the hope that we would show a clear and positive sign that we support international law above national law , yet we pass our own laws to subvert international law . 
the outcome of our actions in boarding the Spanish trawler Estai is that Canada is now in a position to be against international law . 
after five continuous decades of support , we now join those who flaunt international law and make it easier for them to do so . 
the repercussions have been felt by Canada diplomatically in trade and foreign affairs for some considerable time in Europe and elsewhere throughout the United Nations system . 
it might have been worth it , but not one fish was saved because of our actions . 
we may have created Captain Canada , but we did not create laudable human rights goals . 
the third example I wish to point out has been indicated by Senator Wilson . 
senator Fairbairn can speak more eloquently on this than I can , but the truth is that we have a dramatic problem with real illiteracy in Canada . 
rather than using the UNDP designation of No. 1 for Canada as an excuse or defence or for boasting , it would be wise for Canada to exercise humility in attempting to do better . 
surely the real test of human rights standards is how we progress and not how we rate against others . 
we may be grateful to live in a country such as Canada , but it puts a great responsibility on us to improve and to set a better standard than we are doing at present . 
the second behavioural change that it would be advisable for the Canadian government to undergo would be to ensure that other countries conform to the declaration and the covenants that the United Nations have put in place , and which those nations have signed . 
again in recent years , we have fallen short in our responsibility to ensure , through UN implementation mechanisms and other avenues , that other countries are meeting their obligations to the covenants that they have signed or agreed to . 
rather , we have allowed those countries to hide behind their sovereignty and the use of cultural values as reasons not to be held accountable . 
if we were honest and forthright about our own shortcomings , and , if we were truly committed to human rights , there would be no dialogue in Canada about trade first and imposing our values second . 
surely , we should be exercising our responsibilities to ensure that human rights come first . 
in that respect , I believe that the Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade has rightly pointed out that Canada has a commitment to place human rights first and to support conditions that support human rights . 
those conditions include good governance , an independent judiciary and an informed civil society , to name but a few . 
we must immediately stop allowing other countries to hide behind sovereignty . 
as the High Commissioner for Human Rights , Mary Robinson , pointed out recently , good human rights records are in the best interest of trade and business . 
when the actions of countries are grounded on good , independent courts , the rule of law , respect for citizens ' rights and adherence to human rights , then peace and stability follow and , consequently , the appropriate environment in which to build long - term trading relationships . 
one need only look at recent history to know that , despite all our sacrifices of human rights in the Asia - Pacific region , for example , trade has not been assured . 
the regime of Indonesia has not given Canadian trade its legitimacy over human rights . 
one further difficulty with the present Canadian government ' s attitude and policy is noted in Canada ' s foreign policy document . 
in the government ' s response to the recommendations of the special joint parliamentary committee reviewing Canadian foreign policy , the government stated in its reply on February 7 , 1994 , that the government had decided to focus Canada ' s foreign policy on three key objectives : promoting prosperity and employment ; promoting our security within the stable global framework ; and projecting Canadian values and culture . 
canada should not - and I emphasize , " should not " - have as its foreign policy the objective of projecting Canadian values and cultures . 
critics of Canada ' s position are rightly pointing out that it is not our business to export our values and cultures to the world . 
this has never been in keeping with Canada ' s tradition , nor does it serve Canada well . 
while it is fair and necessary for Canada to share Canadian values and to expose other countries to our culture , it is surely not our position to be imposing our value system on others . 
surely Canada ' s role is to ensure adherence to shared human values that are entrenched in the Universal Declaration and its covenants . 
we must push the notion of the universality of these rights . 
it was reassuring recently to hear Minister Marchi point out that there is something new in the trade policy , and that is human rights . 
he went on to say that we would be projecting and promoting our values , our human rights . 
again I would quote Human Rights Commissioner Mary Robinson . 
she stated : 
i believe that most Canadians have been consistent and clear in a commitment to human rights . 
what is necessary is that the Prime Minister and his entire cabinet must follow . 
on motion of Senator Roche , debate adjourned . 
multilateral Agreement on Investment 
inquiry - Debate Continued 
on the Order : 
resuming debate on the inquiry of the Honourable Senator Spivak calling the attention of the Senate to the differences between the proposed Multilateral Agreement on Investment and the NAFTA . - 
( honourable Senator Eyton ) . 
hon. No ë l A . Kinsella ( Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I wish to make a few remarks on this inquiry which is at its fifteenth day . 
i then propose to ask that we adjourn the debate once again in the name of Senator Eyton . 
i would salute my colleague Senator Spivak for calling our attention to some of the differences between the proposed Multilateral Agreement on Investment and the NAFTA . 
this was an important observation . 
we have had some experience with the NAFTA , and in particular the economic impact it has had on Canada . 
although there is some debate , I believe the experience , by and large , has been a positive one as it relates to our economic and social situation in Canada today . 
however , the MAI remains under negotiation . 
that negotiation has moved from the tutelage of the OECD to the World Trade Organization , with the objective of trying to establish some universal principles for the movement of investment capital . 
the negotiators are faced with many difficult corollary issues which speak to the matter of state sovereignty , the economic , social and cultural rights of the peoples in different countries , and to what has often been referred to as the " new " generation of human rights : issues of solidarity , issues of the environment and issues of development . 
as our debate on this important inquiry continues I hope that some of those issues will be addressed . 
i would now move the adjournment of the debate in the name of Senator Eyton . 
on motion of Senator Kinsella , for Senator Eyton , debate adjourned . 
agriculture 
results of First Hemp Crop - Inquiry 
hon. Lorna Milne rose pursuant to notice of December 1 , 1998 : 
that she will call the attention of the Senate to the state of this year ' s fibre hemp crop . 
i also related to you the potential spin - offs and the boundless list of uses of this crop . 
the crop has been sown , harvested and the products are in the stores . 
this year was certainly not without problems . 
it started in May when Health Canada was late , in some cases extremely late , in granting licences . 
separate licences are required to purchase seed and to grow the crop . 
with all the delays , some growers gave up even before they got the crop in the ground . 
Kenex , a hemp processor near Chatham , Ontario , did much of the administration and the research for their 52 growers as the farmers became overwhelmed by all the paperwork . 
planting started late because of all these administrative problems , which was unfortunate as the month of May provided ideal planting weather . 
in spite of that , farmers from various regions of Canada reported a quick emergence of the seed . 
several reported germination two days after planting . 
the farmers are pleased with their result , and most have higher than average yields . 
indeed , several growers were unaware of the requirement for these tests until they received their approved licence . 
the real problems began when farmers started to harvest their crop . 
one man told me that he spent almost a week inside his combine modifying it and it still caught fire the first time around the field . 
i believe it will take a while for the machinery to be refined to work efficiently in North American conditions . 
this year , 2,400 hectares were commercially planted in Canada . 
Ontario farmers seeded 1,163 hectares . 
Manitoba was second with 606 . 
it will be interesting to watch the progress of the industry in these two provinces over the next few years . 
i believe it will come down to Ontario excelling in fibre production and Manitoba in hemp seed . 
it seems that Western Canada does not produce as high a quality of fibre as that grown in the Ontario setting . 
rather , the climate and growing season of the Prairies are more suited for several seed producing varieties of hemp . 
my own particular interest , of course , was in the traditional tobacco - growing farms of southern Ontario . 
Hempline Incorporated of London , Ontario , contracted 500 acres to 20 farmers in southwestern Ontario , 100 of which were grown in the traditional tobacco lands . 
by all accounts , the harvest went very well . 
the yields were affected by the administrative delays in planting , but most farmers will make a profit or break even . 
unfortunately , one group of farmers near Peterborough still has 35 tonnes of high quality hemp seed unsold . 
in British Columbia , the number of growers was far less than predicted . 
the onerous nature of the regulations and applications discouraged many potential growers . 
several farmers ploughed their fields down prior to harvest ; one due to continual theft of the seed head by neighbouring beach dwellers , and another on orders from Health Canada because the grower had been supplied with an unknown mixture of seed varieties . 
in Alberta , Dr. Stanford Blade continued with his research plots . 
the people of the Blood Reserve , in southern Alberta , are getting ready to grow hemp next year . 
Saskatchewan farmers were most affected by the licensing delays . 
one farmer near Regina was unable to plant until July , nearly two months later than desired . 
however , his crop progressed very well and was harvested on September 26 . 
despite a severe drought in Nova Scotia , one grower grew five hectares this year , with great results . 
the crop responded , in spite of dryness , and on day 60 his plants were two metres in height . 
he plans to grow 200 hectares next year and is actively working on plans to build a processing facility in the Annapolis Valley . 
despite the general success with Canada ' s first commercial crop , there is much to learn from research farms . 
in addition to the 2,400 hectares grown commercially , 107 hectares were grown under research licences . 
the growing was not the only success story this season . 
the processing sector is garnering attention from other countries . 
i recently attended the North American Industrial Hemp Council ' s annual conference , in Washington D . C . 
i do not think that ever in Washington ' s history the words " Canada " and " Canadian " have been repeated so often over a two - day period . 
i want to warn Canadians that the Americans are coming . 
political pressure is increasing in the United States for the legalization of industrial hemp . 
Hawaii , North Dakota , Oregon , Illinois , Indiana , Kentucky , Wisconsin and Tennessee all have groups that are pushing strongly for the crop . 
the Oglalla Sioux of the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota passed a resolution for the growing of industrial hemp directly challenging the U.S. federal drug laws and citing NAFTA and GATT in support . 
the Navaha of Arizona planted hemp two years ago . 
in Canada , even in this short time , hemp products are become being readily available . 
it is not just the small , independent organic and health food stores promoting hemp product ; major companies are jumping in as well . 
the Body Shop launched their line of hemp beauty products in October . 
most of the Body Shop products by year ' s end will contain hemp from Saskatchewan fields . 
we have Canadians exploring the possibility using hemp in food and drink products - from cookies and ice cream to cooking oil , beer and pretzels , hemp has it covered . 
Hempline is selling vast fibre to American upholstery plants . 
they are also promoting a line of hemp chips for animal bedding and have reportedly found a buyer for this as well . 
the responses all indicate that the fibre produced in Canada this year is world class . 
stakeholders in Quebec are currently developing hemp for the pulp and paper industry in Lac Saint - Jean and an initiative for combining hemp fibre with recycled cotton to make denim . 
by actively promoting themselves and marketing the possibilities of hemp , Hempline and R & D Hemp of Ontario and Manitoba offered their farmers a guaranteed market for their crop . 
the industry needs to develop on its own and , in this reagrd , there are models of success . 
one encouraging finding reported in Washington was the fact that once manufacturers gain market share , they tend to keep that initial advantage . 
therefore , it behoves Canadian producers and manufacturers to gain and entrench their market share before the Americans get started . 
this is an issue for industry as well as agriculture . 
spin - off industries from hemp production are potential job producers at home as well as a source of export dollars . 
while most involved in the hemp industry had few positive words for Health Canada this spring , upon reflection , most view this inaugural year as a learning year and are willing to assist in working out the bugs before the next season . 
processors and farmers alike have made suggested changes in the application process . 
they would like to see a more concise and easy to understand application form , and an early administration of permits to allow for adequate time to purchase seed . 
to their credit , Health Canada is currently organizing stakeholder meetings to be held early next year in several regions of the country . 
it is my hope that these will prove effective in strengthening the communication between the various levels . 
Canadian farmers are among the best in the world . 
they have proven this year that hemp is a viable crop in Canada . 
whether or not it is an economically viable crop is still to be proven . 
it will depend on the increased efforts of the manufacturing and marketing sectors . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
if no other honourable senator wishes to participate , this inquiry will be considered debated . 
election of Canada to United Nations Security Council 
inquiry - Debate Adjourned 
hon. Douglas Roche rose pursuant to notice of November 19 , 1998 : 
honourable senators , in calling the attention of the Senate to the election of Canada to the United Nations Security Council for 1999 - 2000 , I wish , first , to congratulate the government . 
in doing so , I include the governments of Canada of the past 50 years . 
i do not bring a partisan position to this chamber . 
i sit in this chamber as an independent senator . 
i have worked with both major parties as they formed the Government of Canada . 
in the 25 years that I have worked at the United Nations in one capacity or another , either as parliamentarian , ambassador or consultant and advisor , the strength , dedication and devotion that Canada has brought to the United Nations has always been apparent to me . 
as a matter of fact , I used to be embarrassed when people would comment on the wonderful things Canada that was doing at the United Nations . 
while I would agree with them , I must also say that we need to do better . 
i personally do not appreciate the attacks that have been made on Mr. Axworthy from certain sources . 
i hope those sources will read these words in Hansard and recognize that I speakfor many Canadians . 
in September , I went across this country and spoke in 16 cities . 
i know that the Minister of Foreign Affairs has the support of many Canadians around our country for what he has done towards the elimination of land mines , the development of criminal court , and the advancement of the small arms issues . 
under his leadership , Canada will continue to play a strong role in the United Nations Security Council . 
for the sixth time Canada has been elected as a member of the Security Council . 
hardly another country in the world has been elected so often . 
before I leave this subject , I would also congratulate the current Canadian ambassador to the United Nations , Bob Fowler , who has done an outstanding job . 
i know how easy it is for a country to lose an election for membership to the Security Council if that country ' s resident ambassador is not doing his or her job . 
therefore , I sincerely congratulate Bob Fowler . 
honourable senators , now that we are on the Security Council , what will we do there ? 
we are leaving behind a century that has been the bloodiest century in the history of humanity . 
more than 100 million people have been killed in war deaths in this century . 
we must lower that number in the next century . 
currently , 1.2 billion people do not have enough water , sanitation facilities or adequate health care . 
they do not have the basic amenities of life . 
can we not do better in next century ? 
we are leaving behind a century in which we have despoiled the environment , emitted warming gasses that are now depleting the atmosphere , causing ozone depletion , the spread of deserts and the ruination of forests which , in turn , cause the migration of untold numbers of peoples who have become uprooted from their homes . 
can we not improve that situation in the next century ? 
we are leaving behind a century in which human rights violations have been massive . 
we have had the Holocaust ; we have had genocide ; we have had exterminations of peoples ; we have had slaughters of peoples . 
can we not do better in the next century ? 
honourable senators , we can and we must do better in the next century . 
canada has a great responsibility and a very special role to play . 
the United Nations reminds us of this when they name us as the No. 1 country in the world , when you apply all the quality - of - life indices about longevity and health and so on . 
however , we cannot live solely for ourselves in this country . 
we are one - half of one per cent of the people of the world , occupying land space as the second largest country in the world . 
do you think we can escape the tremendous problems that the world is now facing and that will come increasingly in the next century ? 
indeed , we cannot . 
therefore , I say that the hopes and fears and the grief and anxieties of humanity must be the hopes and fears and the grief and anxieties of Canadians themselves . 
we cannot do everything for everyone . That is certain . 
nor should we try , and I do not suggest that . 
however , we can help to build the conditions for peace and security in the world that is ahead . 
my message is short . 
we must build up the multilateral systems of world management so that , in a responsible way , we can help the management of the planet . 
no one country can solve the problems of today , so massive are they . 
i will give you an indication of some of the problems the world is facing that cannot be resolved by action only at the national level . 
they are problems that respect no borders , such as organized crime , trafficking in children and drugs , the AIDS pandemic , decertification , ozone depletion . 
there are problems that share the common denominator of poverty , malnutrition , illiteracy , inadequate housing , unemployment . 
with increasing frequency , these problems escalate into crisis and disaster . 
there are problems that tear at the roots of our societies in developing and industrialized countries alike - crime , racism , ethnic strife , violence against women , political and social exclusion , and massive violations of human rights . 
that list , honourable senators , can go on and on . 
i will not drag down through excessive pessimism the assessment of this problem as we take our place in the Security Council . 
rather , I want this to be an empowering experience for us , because we do have the capacity in our country to make a change . 
we can help to develop the world system of better management from our place on the Security Council by three sets of priorities . 
i will only say a few words on each , although each of these priorities is itself probably the subject of a full speech . 
the first is the development of international law . 
we ought to have at the foremost of our considerations as we take our place on the Security Council , a privileged place , that we must have the development of a human community under world law if we are to survive these massive problems that afflict the 21 st century . 
we are starting in that direction , and Canada should take its share of the credit in the development of the international criminal court which just started . 
the International Court of Justice has been around a long time , and it is part of the Charter of the United Nations . 
it is part of the wing of the whole UN , and the major powers are ignoring what the International Court of Justice says . 
in its most important advisory opinion ever given on the question of nuclear weapons , the International Court of Justice said that use or threat of use of nuclear weapons would generally contravene every aspect of humanitarian law . 
it said with one voice that nations must conclude a set of negotiations that would lead to a program for nuclear disarmament . 
that opinion is being ignored by the major powers . 
i want Canada to go into the Security Council and raise its voice . 
for some reason , the preposterous notion has grown through the years that the Security Council does not deal with the question of nuclear weapons . 
the Security Council is charged with dealing with peace and security ; that is its main reason for being , and yet it leaves it to other bodies to hold the conference on disarmament and to deal with the problem of nuclear weapons . 
i say Canada ought to bring the question of nuclear weapons into the discussions , debates , and votes of the Security Council . 
the second major priority that Canada should bring to the Security Council is the question of democracy . 
we live at a time when democracy is spreading around the world . 
one of the most undemocratic places I have ever seen in my experience is the United Nations itself , and that is because of the hold on power by the five major powers . 
they have held to themselves the veto power given them at the end of World War II , when the world was totally different . 
fifty - one countries signed the Charter in 1945 , and now there are 185 countries , because of the development of peoples of the world who are no longer represented on the Security Council on a permanent basis . 
can you imagine that the entire continent of Africa does not have a permanent seat , that the entire continent of South America does not have a permanent seat , and that the entire continent of Asia , which holds half the people of the world , only has one seat ? 
of course it must be reformed and democratized . 
they did have one summit meeting . 
in the entire 53 - year history of the United Nations , there has been one meeting of the Security Council at the summit level , and that was on January 30 , 1992 . 
i will not go into the reasons here why they felt it propitious at that time . 
nonetheless , as we cross over into the next century , if we are to have meetings of the G - 8 every year , which gets to be tiresome after a while considering how little they do , surely Canada could go to the Security Council from its seat on the Security Council and say , " Let us have a meeting of the Security Council at its summit in order to discuss these key problems of poverty and nuclear weapons , and other weapons of mass destruction , as the chief impediments to peace and security , which is what the Security Council is supposed to be doing . " 
let us have a better partnership as governments to advance that agenda . 
the third priority that I would suggest for Canada to advance at the Security Council is the priority I call an umbrella of human rights . 
we just heard a speech from a distinguished ambassador , Senator Andreychuk , on human rights . 
briefly , I would say that it is not enough to observe the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights , as we are now doing . 
for an important reason , the United Nations General Assembly has selected the decade 2001 - 10 as the International Decade for the Advancement of the Rights for Peace with Special Application to Children . 
that is an important measure to extend and deepen the concept of human rights that Canada ought to be advancing at every turn . 
finally , in this respect , I hope that Canada will never give its assent to any form of military intervention in any country conducted by any country unless it has the express authorization of the UN Security Council . 
the Secretary General of the United Nations , Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar , himself specified that at the time . 
my point is that Canada has a duty to the citizens of this country who want to espouse the values of peace and reconciliation through arbitration and mediation . 
military force is a last resort only , not a first resort . 
therefore , we must follow what the former secretary general of the United Nations , Mr. Boutros - Ghali , said in his agenda for peace . 
he said that we should work much harder for preventive diplomacy , to try to solve problems upstream before they happen , rather than downstream after they have happened . 
nothing could be a sharper example of what I mean than the problem of nuclear weapons . 
honourable senators , we must solve the problem of nuclear weapons before it is too late , and Canada can bring those views into the Security Council . 
finally , they talk about the reform of the UN and administrative reform . 
that is fine . 
i am all for administrative reform . 
however , the true reform that Canada must speak up for in the United Nations as we go into the next century is a reform of the attitude of the major powers so that they will begin to recognize that they are part of this international human community , not the dominators of it . 
hon. Marcel Prud ' homme : 
honourable senators , I believe the Honourable Senator Graham wishes to adjourn this debate in his name . 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
No. 
senator Prud ' homme : 
it seems there is a pre - disposition by many senators to adjourn debate on this issue . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , if no one moves the adjournment , I have no alternative . 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , I privately indicated an interest in participating in the debate at some point . 
it is not my intention to speak at the present time , nor before the adjournment . 
however , if any other honourable senator wishes to speak , they can take the adjournment and I will speak in due course . 
senator Prud ' homme : 
honourable senators , you will remember that I started this matter . 
on motion of Senator Graham , debate adjourned . 
canada - Japan Inter - Parliamentary Group 
third Annual Visit with Diet Members in Japan - Ninth Annual Meeting with Japan - Canada Friendship League , Held in Alberta - Executive Committee Meeting of Asia - Pacific Parliamentary Forum Held in Peru - Sixth General Assembly of Asia - Pacific Parliamentary Conference on the Environment and Development Held in China - Inquiry 
hon. Dan Hays rose pursuant to notice of December 2 , 1998 : 
that he will call the attention of the Senate to the third annual visit of the Canada - Japan Inter - Parliamentary Group with Diet Members in Japan from May 22 to June 2 ; the Ninth Annual Meeting between the Canada - Japan Inter - Parliamentary Group and the Japan - Canada Parliamentarians Friendship League , held in Alberta from August 21 to 28 ; the Executive Committee Meeting of the Asia - Pacific Parliamentary Forum , held in Peru from September 6 to 8 ; and the Sixth General Assembly of the Asia - Pacific Parliamentarians ' Conference on Environment and Development , held in China from October 14 to 18 , 1998 . 
these include a special visit , the third of its kind , to Japan in the spring of this year ; our ninth annual meeting between the Canada - Japan Inter - Parliamentary Group and the Japan - Canada Parliamentarians Friendship League , held in Banff , Calgary , Edmonton and Fort McMurray this summer ; an executive committee meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum held in Lima , Peru , in September ; and something new - our participation in the Sixth General Assembly of the Asia Pacific Parliamentarians Conference on Environment and Development held in Guilin , China , in October . 
first of all , there are annual meetings that alternate between the two countries . 
( see the report on the eighth annual meeting between the Canada - Japan Inter - Parliamentary Group and the Japan - Canada Parliamentarians Friendship League . ) 
then there is the president ' s annual visit , or blitz as it is called , to Diet members . 
the first annual visit occurred in 1995 . 
it allowed us to advance specific Canadian interests in the housing sector and to promote Canada ' s Action Plan for Japan . 
the second annual visit further raised the Canadian profile and introduced at the parliamentary level the idea of building a closer bilateral peace and security dialogue . 
on this matter , I am pleased to report that a very successful symposium on bilateral peace and security cooperation between Japan and Canada was held in Vancouver September 11 to 12 , 1998 . 
our meetings were productive and covered the following areas : peace and security , including the ratification of the international Anti - Personnel Landmines Convention ; agriculture in the context of the next multilateral round of agricultural trade policy talks due to start in 1999 ; financial and commercial interests ; and culture . 
after meeting with senior Diet members , journalists and academics , we concluded that although Japan ' s economy is in recession , financial sector stabilization , deregulation , and improved supervision - combined with the inherent strengths of their economy - all give us reason to be optimistic about the potential for Canadian companies wishing to do business in Japan . 
we had the pleasure of meeting a number of young Canadians participating in the Japan English Teachers ' Program , or JET , established by former prime minister Nakasone as a means of exposing young foreigners to Japanese culture . 
i am proud to report that there are presently more than 850 young Canadians in the JET program , the highest representation of any participating country on a per capita basis . 
our visit also took us to the Tohoku and Hokkaido Regions , both of which offer potential for Canadian investments and further trade opportunities . 
the Tohoku Region accounts for one - fifth of Japan ' s total area , approximately 10 per cent of its total population and 8 per cent of its gross national product . 
we met individually with several opinion - makers and elected officials , including Mr. Shiro Asano , the Governor of the Miyagi Prefecture . 
we also hosted a luncheon for representatives of several corporations currently conducting business with Canadian firms . 
the Island of Hokkaido is much less densely populated than Japan ' s other large islands and its northerly climate more closely resembles that of Canada . 
we met with representatives of the Hokkaido International Business Association - which is an association of young entrepreneurs - with local opinion - makers and with local elected officials , including Governor Tatsuya Hori of Hokkaido . 
in each of these meetings we stressed the importance of maintaining close ties between Canada and Japan . 
as some honourable senators may know , the Island of Hokkaido is twinned with the Province of Alberta , and there are currently 23 urban areas in Japan that are twinned with Canadian towns and cities . 
furthermore , we are attempting to arrange an exchange of editorials between the Calgary Herald and the Hokkaido Shimbun Press on a theme such as the impact of the Asian financial crisis . 
a highlight of the visit was a trip to central Hokkaido to meet with officials from twinned cities . 
we exchanged the flags of the towns of Canmore and Higashikawa and visited with the mayors and officials of the towns of Kamikawa , Kamiyubetsu , Okoppe and Tokoro , which are twinned with the Alberta towns of Rocky Mountain House , Whitecourt , Stettler and Barrhead , respectively . 
toward the conclusion of the visit , I had the pleasure of addressing the annual meeting of the Hokkaido - Canada Society on the theme of " Canada and Japan : 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
i regret to interrupt the honourable senator , but it is now 6 p.m. , and I must leave the Chair , unless there is agreement not to see the clock . 
hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , there is agreement not to see the clock . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , is it agreed that I not see the clock ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
senator Hays : 
i thank honourable senators . 
honourable Senators , the third annual visit to Japan demonstrated that the networks and friendships built through parliamentary associations are very valuable in promoting Canadian interests abroad . 
the warm welcome extended to us and the openness of the conversations concerning the challenges facing Japan underscored the international reputation that Canada has earned as a caring nation with a vibrant economy and an abundance of natural resources . 
honourable senators , I would like to comment on the ninth annual meeting between the Canada - Japan Inter - Parliamentary Group and the Japan - Canada Parliamentarians Friendship League held in Alberta from August 21 to 28 , 1998 . 
this week in Alberta gave delegates from both countries first - hand experience of the various aspects of bilateral relations , thus helping to further strengthen the growing personal ties between Japanese and Canadian politicians and business people , as well as public servants and academics . 
although the formal bilateral consultations held at the University of Alberta were the central event of the ninth annual meeting , the overall program provided a wealth of information to both the Canadian and Japanese delegates on cultural , commercial , economic , agricultural , natural resources and environmental issues . 
i should like to mention that the head of the Japanese league received an honorary doctorate from the University of Alberta for his support of the construction of the pavillion and the garden . 
Dr. Roderick Fraser , President of the University of Alberta , and the Honourable David Hancock , the Alberta Minister of Inter - governmental and Aboriginal Affairs , hosted formal dinners in honour of the ninth annual meeting and in recognition of the support and contribution of Dr. Tatsuo Ozawa . 
members of Parliament , members of the Alberta Legislative Assembly and community and business leaders attended the dinners . 
on the final evening , the Canada - Japan Business Association of Edmonton hosted a formal dinner at which Dr. Ozawa was the keynote speaker . 
he gave an important speech explaining the current economic situation in his country . 
in the bilateral consultations , we discussed the political and economic situations in both Canada and Japan ; international affairs ; peace and security ; and trade and culture . 
honourable senators , I now turn to comments concerning Canada ' s attendance at a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Asia - Pacific Parliamentary Forum . 
the United States , a regular member of the executive committee , was unable to participate and invited Canada to attend in light of their absence . 
this was timely since Canada is currently seeking a position on the executive committee . 
i remind honourable senators that Canada hosted the successful fifth annual meeting of the Asia - Pacific Parliamentary Forum in Vancouver , which Your Honour attended . 
the Asia - Pacific Parliamentary Forum , now in its seventh year , is growing in importance . 
what goes on in the Asia - Pacific region is of great importance to Canada : concerns about environmental changes around the world , the security and stability of the Korean peninsula , the efforts aimed at eliminating anti - personnel mines , the impact of technological change , requirements for honest trade and the elimination of corruption are but a few examples of the questions the meeting dealt with . 
canada is one of the founding members of the APPF and hosted the fifth meeting in Vancouver in 1997 . 
we are looking forward to participating in the seventh annual meeting in Lima . 
it is our hope that we will be able to promote government initiatives , such as the elimination of small arms and an improved international monetary surveillance system . 
in October , I had the pleasure of attending the sixth General Assembly of the Asia - Pacific Parliamentarians Conference on Environment and Development . 
the conference was established in 1993 by the Korean parliamentary league for children , the public and the environment to mark the first anniversary of the Rio Earth Summit . 
the theme of the conference was " The Sustainable Development of Tourism . " 
the plenary sessions and the resulting joint communiqu é , known as the Guilin Declaration , focussed on the following three areas of discussion . 
they included relations between tourism development and environmental and natural resource protection ; principles and strategies for the sustainable development of tourism ; and the promotion of sustainable tourism development through enhanced international cooperation . 
participation in this assembly was a positive experience , having laid the groundwork for future parliamentary contacts and cooperation . 
future participation should be considered worthwhile . 
to this end , the report that I tabled in this chamber last week offered recommendations for consideration . 
i commend the report to honourable senators . 
for my part , I am proud of the work of the Canada - Japan Inter - Parliamentary Group and the Asia - Pacific Parliamentary Forum . 
i look forward to continuing to work with members of both this chamber and of the other place in advancing Canada ' s interests in the Asia - Pacific region . 
honourable senators , I should like to confirm my strong belief that the importance of international parliamentary associations in informing parliamentarians on policies in other countries must not be underestimated in this new age of international interdependence . 
what transpires in other regions of the world has tremendous consequences for Canada , as do our actions for other regions . 
parliamentary associations are also about those valuable friendships and bonds that are built between parliamentarians of different countries over time . 
i invite all honourable senators to participate in the work of the association . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
if no other honourable senator wishes to speak , this inquiry shall be considered debated .

senators ' STATEMENTS 
international Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 
hon. Donald H . Oliver : 
honourable senators , this is the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . 
the celebration we are participating in , however , is coloured by Canada ' s appalling progress in eliminating racial discrimination . 
the 1997 Canadian Human Rights Report bears testament to this embarrassing reality . 
in her annual report , Commissioner Michelle Falardeau - Ramsay states : 
in contrast to the private sector , the share of recruitment of visible minorities by the government ... 
- that is , the federal government - 
... remained consistently below availability . 
in more blunt terms , the report also notes that " visible minorities have not fared well in the public service , " and that human rights tribunals have found that Health Canada " had discriminated against visible minorities in the appointment of executives .... " 
on November 30 , 1963 , the General Assembly of the United Nations proclaimed a resolution to eliminate racial discrimination . 
in 1969 , the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination came into force . 
this was a landmark convention . 
it employed language which was forceful , recriminating and aggressive in its opposition to racial discrimination . 
one clause in particular states that parties to this convention are : 
convinced that any doctrine of superiority based on racial differentiation is scientifically false , morally condemnable , socially unjust and dangerous , and that there is no justification for racial discrimination , in theory or in practice , anywhere .... 
traditionally , the Progressive Conservative Party has always worked hard to eliminate all forms of racism in Canada . 
in 1988 , Parliament enacted the Canadian Multiculturalism Act , which made Canada the first country in the world to pass national multiculturalism legislation . 
this act made the government responsible for promoting and furthering the understanding that Canadian society is culturally and racially diverse . 
in 1988 , the Progressive Conservative government also reached an agreement with Japanese Canadians on terms of redress for their treatment during the Second World War . 
this redress marked a very important development in Canadian politics and history . 
honourable senators , the need to fight racial discrimination is as important as ever . 
declining levels of overt forms of discrimination are being replaced with subtler forms of discrimination , such as the dismal rate of appointments and advancement of visible minorities to middle and senior levels of our public service . 
we must be vigilant to ensure that Canadian society keeps advancing in this area so that our public and private business institutions reflect the cultural diversity of Canada and of their workforces . 
through better education and social awareness , we must ensure that the next generation of our children and grandchildren never live through the scourge of discrimination as we have . 
united Nations 
convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women 
hon. Ron Ghitter : 
honourable senators , the preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that " ... the peoples of the United Nations reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights , in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women . " 
following that declaration some 50 years ago , the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination again Women was drafted between 1973 and 1979 , adopted in December of 1979 , and entered into force in 1981 following ratification by 20 countries . 
today it has been ratified by 161 state parties . 
the convention defines discrimination against women and then outlines measures by which it can be counteracted . 
you would think that such declarations would be unnecessary for a segment of the world population that comprises over one half of the world ' s number , namely women . 
you would think that legislation would not be required in order to counteract discrimination , subjugation and violence against such a large number of citizens on this planet . 
you would think that women , by their very numbers , would have an equal voice in the affairs of their communities and families . 
however , an objective examination of the issue discloses enormous inequities in the areas of violence against women , of poverty , of refugees , of participation in the workforce , and of political participation . 
an examination of any one of those areas quickly brings one to the conclusion that women are not treated equally , and that women face tremendous discrimination , not only in Canada but even more so throughout the rest of the world . 
in terms of the workforce in Canada , and the participation of women in that workforce , there is no doubt that there are now more women in the workforce in Canada than ever before . 
however , they earn around 25 per cent less than do their male counterparts holding similar jobs . 
in the area of political participation , it is encouraging to see the advancement of women reflected in the numbers now participating in political life , particularly in municipal politics . 
however , there is still a gross underrepresentation of women conducting affairs of state . 
in the area of education , there are encouraging signs in Canada , as seen by the number of women in postgraduate courses at our universities . 
clearly , over 50 per cent of the faculties have women in them , rather than men . 
more political involvement means more focus and attention on issues involving women that hitherto have been of low priority in a male - dominated business and political environment . 
approximately two weeks ago , in Edmonton , a panel talked in terms of the rights of women in the world . 
the title of the discussion was , " Recognising the Inherent Dignity and Rights of Women : 
a Mirage in the Distance ? " 
the challenge for us all is to turn the rhetoric relating to women into reality . 
that is the challenge that we face in this country , namely , to advance these causes internally and to use our influence to encourage the advancement of human rights everywhere in the world . 
as we celebrate the 50 th anniversary of the signing of the declaration this week , we are not content - nor must we be content . 
we must not be satisfied . 
we are not naive to think that the battle has been won and that women have achieved equal rights , for they have not . 
we are only reminded this week of the tremendous effort that is required to turn the rhetoric into reality . 
national Defence 
incidence of Canadian Patrol Frigates putting to Sea without Sea King Helicopter 
hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
honourable senators , yesterday we were told about the government ' s rationale in having to deliver an injured sailor to St. John ' s . 
a Labrador headed out to do the " medivac , " but could not go all the way due to icing . 
what that has to do with Labradors , I do not know . 
these helicopters fly , they do not float . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , order , please ! 
may we have some order so that we can hear the honourable senator ? 
senator Forrestall : 
the fact remains that a Canadian patrol frigate had to go to sea on patrol without a Sea King helicopter , and then was called upon to carry out a crucial mission . 
the Sea King is an extension of the ship ' s sensors and performs as a force multiplier . 
let us not be misled : 
high - readiness ships are supposed to have helicopters , and I suspect that a ship on patrol is a " high readiness " ship . 
that is the problem - not icing or high seas . 
it should be grounded . 
i agree with the Leader of the Government in the Senate when he says that " grounding " has a legal definition , and it is imposed by the Chief of the Air Staff . 
it was a flight restriction only in the minds of the press , and a convenient smokescreen . 
it was not a grounding . 
it was a half - measure flight restriction to avoid political embarrassment . 
let us have no more half measures . 
let us ground the Labrador fleet , and officially pass primary search and rescue responsibility to the Sea King fleet . 
at the very least , the Sea King crews and their leadership could do some long - term planning to get around some of the current training problems that they face . 
f . W . Schumacher 
father Christmas of Northern Ontario Town 
hon. Francis William Mahovlich : 
honourable senators , this being the festive season , I thought it would be appropriate to tell you a Christmas story that I experienced in my childhood , and how fortunate I was to be born in Canada , and in Northern Ontario , in particular . 
in 1945 , my father thought it was time to get off the farm so we moved to a little town called Schumacher . 
the " Mr. Schumacher " that the town was named after was our very own Santa Claus . 
Mr. Schumacher then went to the University of Columbus . 
it was during Prohibition that he entered the business world . 
his business was selling cough syrup . 
however , that cough syrup happened to be 45 per cent alcohol . 
he amassed a fortune . 
he sold it not only by the truckload but also by the trainload . 
well , Prohibition ended . 
Mr. Schumacher ' s business closed and he had to look for another business . 
he picked up a newspaper and saw that there was a gold strike in Northern Ontario , so off he went . 
during his time there , he did very well . 
he was very fortunate . 
he went to Europe and began to purchase great art. 
if you visit the art museum located in Columbus , Ohio , you will be able to see his art collection . 
all the students and all the children in the area , which had a population of about 3,500 , would receive a gift at Christmas from Mr. Schumacher - whether it be a sleigh , a pair of skates , a hockey stick or a hockey sweater . 
one year , I received a hockey sweater - a Detroit Red Wings hockey sweater - and a pair of socks . 
i immediately changed my allegiance from the Toronto Maple Leafs over to the Detroit Red Wings because of that sweater ! 
my point is that this man was extremely generous . 
he passed away in 1957 . 
about three or four years ago , I had a chance to visit with some of the friends with whom I went to school . 
some of them are now principals and teachers there . 
they told me another story involving the Schumacher family ' s generosity . 
they were presented with another $ 3 million so that the Christmas tradition that was initiated by Mr. Schumacher could continue . 
even today , a young boy in the little town of Schumacher receives a gift from the late F . W . Schumacher . 
indeed , the spirit of Christmas is alive and well in the Town of Schumacher ! 
hon. Senators : 
hear , hear !

Wednesday , December 9 , 1998 
the Standing Committee on Privileges , Standing Rules and Orders has the honour to present its 
seventh REPORT 
your committee recommends that the following rule be added to the Rules of the Senate :

( 3 ) In the French version , the masculine gender is used throughout , without any intent to discriminate but solely to make the text easier to read . 
the distinction in French should not be between " masculine " and " feminine " genders but between " marked " and " unmarked " genders ; the so - called masculine gender is an unmarked gender and can therefore represent , by itself , elements of both genders . 
the feminine gender is marked and therefore cannot be used to refer to elements of both genders . "

national Defence 
search and Rescue Capability - Projected Delivery Date of First Vehicle Under Cancelled Contract for EH - 101 Helicopters - Government Position 
hon. John Lynch - Staunton ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , the Leader of the Government in the Senate yesterday said again in so many words that even had the EH - 101 contract not been cancelled , certain tragic events over the past few months could not have been avoided . 
he stated : 
my information is that those helicopters ... 
- meaning the EH - 101 s - 
... would not be available until late next year . 
senator Graham ' s information is incorrect . 
in the Estimates of the Department of National Defence , Part III 1993 - 94 ( Supplementary Information ) , page 157 , there is a full summary of what was then known as the New Shipborne Aircraft / New Search and Rescue Helicopter Project . 
in July 1992 , the government announced its intention to proceed with the acquisition of 50 EH - 101 helicopters for the combined NSA / NSH requirement . 
thirty - five EH - 101 s were to be shipborne helicopters to be used for various military purposes as well as for , and I quote from the information in the National Defence estimates : 
... fisheries patrols , drug interdiction , pollution monitoring and maritime search and rescue . 
the fifteen other EH - 101 s were to : 
... support a national search and rescue capability . 
the contract was awarded to European Helicopter Industries Ltd. and to Paramax . 
EHIL was to build the helicopter and Paramax was to : 
... design , integrate and install the applicable mission equipment suite to produce the final NSA and NSH prime mission vehicles . 
senator Forrestall was quite correct yesterday in claiming that had this delivery schedule been respected , there could be up to 12 EH - 101 helicopters available today , all of which could easily have been equipped with basic search and rescue systems , as opposed to the more complicated anti - submarine warfare system which takes much longer to install and to test . 
based on this information , does the Leader of the Government in the Senate still maintain that the EH - 101 helicopter contract cancellation - a cancellation , by the way , made strictly for political purposes as part of the Liberal Party ' s spiteful anti - Mulroney tirade during and following the 1993 election - has not jeopardized the effectiveness of the search and rescue squadron or put lives in danger by forcing crews to use Labradors which , to all intents and purposes , are obsolete and should be scrapped once and for all ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , the Leader of the Opposition brings forward a very interesting point of view and some information which I certainly would want to examine . 
i am sure that he understands that I was basing my answers on information that had been provided to me . 
i relied on that information to be accurate . 
if indeed there is further information which can shed more light and which proves my statement to be inaccurate , I shall be happy to clarify . 
with respect to the decision to cancel the contract that was undertaken by the previous government , that was a government decision . 
i am saddened to think that we would connect that with any loss of life because it was judged that the Labrador helicopters were safe to fly at that particular time . 
discussions and examinations conducted by officials in the Department of National Defence resulted in the decision to cancel the previous government ' s contract . 
i understand that there are two basic and very practical reasons for the cancellation . 
first , the requirements for that particular type of helicopter changed in a changing world . 
second , the savings to the taxpayers amounted to at least $ 30 million per unit . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
thirty million dollars per unit , not including the $ 750 million cancellation costs . 
senator Graham : 
including the cancellation costs . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
no , sir . 
you should check your information again , Senator Graham . 
hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
honourable senators , I rise on a supplementary question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate . 
i trust I am not going too far when I muse out loud and ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether there has not been some kind of a cover - up . 
everybody knew at the time of the order what the situation was with respect to that airplane and the three engines , its lift capacity , its large doors - in other words , its basic configuration , not something all dressed up . 
there is no question we could have had it much cheaper , and I am surprised that the minister would raise the issue of $ 30 million in cost savings per unit and then suggest it included the $ 1 - billion cancellation fee and the public bathing we took over this decision , all of which is not important . 
my question is very basic . 
when will you put helicopters on the decks of those frigates ? 
when ? 
if you do not intend to do it , say so . 
senator Graham : 
as I said yesterday , honourable senators , the Canadian Forces make judgments with respect to the operations of our vessels at sea . 
in reference to the HMCS Halifax , it was not considered essential that a Sea King helicopter be on the ship at that particular time for that kind of an operation . 
senator Forrestall : 
honourable senators , the leader told us yesterday that the Labrador could not fly because of icing problems . 
that Labrador made flights earlier in the day and did not have any icing problem . 
one flight was 300 kilometres , and another 200 kilometres . 
it did not make that much of a difference . 
a latter reason was high seas . 
i do not know how high seas affect the operation of a helicopter . 
which is it ? 
the leader cannot have it three ways from Sunday . 
does the government have a policy that it will send these high - readiness ships on active sea patrol and not give them their eyes and extension ? 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , I do not know that I specifically mentioned high seas in reference to helicopters . 
however , I certainly did mention icing conditions . 
the honourable senator said that the helicopter flew in the morning . 
obviously conditions can change in a matter of half an hour with respect to icing . 
senator Forrestall : 
why it was it not sent out when conditions changed ? 
senator Graham : 
is the honourable senator talking about the situation that occurred in Quebec ? 
senator Forrestall : 
i am talking about the HMCS Halifax sitting 300 miles off the East Coast without a helicopter on it and having to go for 15 or 20 hours to bring a seriously injured seaman to hospital in St. John ' s . 
if the sea conditions and the weather conditions had changed in an hour , why did they not dispatch the Labrador ? 
senator Graham : 
i said that there were dangerous icing conditions that prevented the Labrador from Gander from reaching the ship . 
obviously , conditions changed during the day . 
the Senate 
meeting of Privileges , Standing Rules and Orders Committee Conflicting with Caucus Meetings - Position of Chairman of Committee 
hon. No ë l A . Kinsella ( Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , my question is directed to the Chair of the Standing Committee on Privileges , Standing Rules and Orders . 
did the chair convene a meeting of that standing committee this morning at eleven o ' clock ? 
hon. Shirley Maheu : 
yes , I did , honourable senators . 
we had called a meeting for yesterday afternoon , which was not appropriate for many members on both sides of the house , I might add . 
this morning was the only time that we had left . 
our clerk felt that it was imperative that we meet because we had a French correction to make . 
you , senator , are one of the ones who continuously talks about gender and sexist language . 
that was the reason for clarifying the text . 
the meeting was to last 15 minutes at the outside . 
unfortunately , some of the senators wanted to raise other matters . 
two caucuses were meeting , but that was the only time we had . 
it was not a decisive meeting with votes . 
senator Kinsella : 
honourable senators , it is a long tradition in this place that caucuses and caucus meetings are central to our Westminster parliamentary system . 
Wednesday mornings , the respective caucuses of this place have meetings . 
it has been our tradition or custom never to hold committee meetings when our caucuses are meeting on Wednesday morning . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
liberal arrogance ! 
senator Maheu : 
honourable senators , it was not Liberal arrogance . 
it had nothing to do with being a Liberal or a Tory . 
my committee will not meet again on a Wednesday morning when his party is holding caucus . 
we had caucus as well , I might add . 
hon. Norman K . Atkins : 
might I ask whether attendance was taken at that meeting ? 
senator Maheu : 
yes , the clerk has the attendance at the meeting . 
would you like me to obtain the list and tell you what time they arrived ? 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
no , what time they left . 
senator Atkins : 
was anyone who is a member of that committee and did not attend marked absent when they were in fact sitting in national caucus ? 
senator Maheu : 
if the committee was sitting during national caucus , the Senate was not sitting . 
absences are marked when the Senate is sitting , not when caucuses are meeting . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
that is Liberal arrogance . 
solicitor General 
attacks on Protestors in Vancouver by Security Forces - Remarks of Prime Minister on Democracy - Government Position 
hon. No ë l A . Kinsella ( Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
the Toronto Star says that democracy is noisy and that it is messy sometimes . 
the Globe and Mail today says sometimes democracy is noisy . 
last evening , honourable senators , the Prime Minister articulated a new philosophy of parliamentary democracy where he announced that while coming to the meeting he saw some protesters who were noisy ; that democracy is noisy and messy sometimes . 
how exactly is democracy messy ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I believe it was Winston Churchill who once said that democracy is the worst form of government , except for all the rest . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
what did the Prince of Darkness say ? 
senator Graham : 
senator Lynch - Staunton again raises the question of the " forces of darkness . " 
i refer to my response to Senator Andreychuk ' s question about keeping the Christmas lights lit on Parliament Hill until after certain feast days , and certainly a week after January 3 , when the lights are normally turned off . 
may I use this moment to say that I brought her representations , and indeed the endorsement of all members of the chamber , directly to the attention of the chairman of the National Capital Commission . 
while I cannot now make any kind of announcement , he responded favourably to the suggestion . 
while I am at it , may I congratulate the National Capital Commission for the wonderful display that they have on the Hill and elsewhere in the nation ' s capital ? 
it may be that you will not be referring to the " forces of darkness " in the future when you put questions , but you may be calling me the " angel of light . " 
i acknowledge that that is really reaching . 
the choice of words , of course , would be the Prime Minister ' s , but certainly democracy can be difficult , and I am glad that he made the statement that he did . 
i happened to be in Cape Breton recently , and I was invited to be the guest speaker at a dinner in the premier ' s home riding , in Sydney Mines . 
i arrived on schedule , and the premier had been there a few minutes ahead of me . 
we were greeted by protesters and picketers , and the police . 
it was suggested that perhaps we should leave . 
i drove back to Sydney , and got through by telephone to the people who were holed up in the Knights of Columbus hall in Sydney Mines . 
senator Buchanan has spoken at many rallies there , and I am sure Senator Comeau , Senator Forrestall and Senator Murray have done the same . 
at any rate , I was told that the picketers and the police had left , and that there were a few people coming through the fields who had already bought their tickets for the event . 
i was asked to come back . 
i went back and spoke to them about democracy , people ' s right to demonstrate , people ' s right to picket and people ' s right to express their concern . 
i have been all over the world observing the forces of democracy in action . 
senator Berntson : 
do you remember what the question was ? 
hon. Ron Ghitter : 
honourable senators , I have listened to the answer just given , if indeed it was an answer . 
as one who turned on the TV last night and saw young Canadians being bludgeoned with clubs for coming to demonstrate on an issue that this government had side - stepped , blockaded and stonewalled through the last month , I find the answer that has been given by the Leader of the Government unacceptable . 
is this the government policy , that when someone protests you bring out the police with clubs ? 
is that what Canada has come to ? 
is the " messiness " referring to the blood on the faces of those bludgeoned last night with clubs ? 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , let me say first that the Prime Minister has a right to go wherever he is invited in this country . 
he was a guest of the people of British Columbia , and most particularly in the City of Vancouver . 
let me review for Senator Ghitter the responsibilities with respect to the protective services that were provided . 
the Hyatt Hotel , where the event was held , would have been responsible for security within the hotel . 
however , Vancouver City Police had the lead responsibility for security around the building and in the streets . 
they were prepared for a large event because of the publicity leading up to night ' s event . 
the role of the RCMP was to assist the Vancouver City Police . 
they were there primarily in their role as contracted provincial police services , but would also have provided support if the Prime Minister required additional security . 
i feel it is important for us to have that information . 
the unfortunate events that took place were not prompted by the Prime Minister , nor by the people whom he might direct in terms of his own protection . 
the responsibility for his personal protection lies with the RCMP . 
as I have outlined , there were other forces which took part in those security arrangements . 
senator Ghitter : 
honourable senators , with respect , that is hardly an answer to my question . 
why does the leader not acknowledge the fact that his government has bungled the situation and , as a result , that is why these students are coming forward and demonstrating , and that it will continue ? 
why not just admit it and get on with it ? 
some Hon. Senators : 
hear , hear ! 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , I do not know how many times I must repeat , for the edification and enlightenment of Senator Ghitter and other senators opposite , that there is a process in place . 
we wish to follow that due process . 
senator Ghitter : 
it is not working . 
senator Graham : 
senator Ghitter alleges , while sitting in his place , that the process is not working . 
we believe it can work , and we wish to give it a chance . 
there are matters that are now being considered by the Federal Court , for which institution I am sure the Honourable Senator Ghitter has the greatest respect . 
it is to be hoped that the Public Complaints Commission will be able to resume its work in the near future . 
i say , let the Public Complaints Commission do its work , and allow it to live up to its mandate . 
hon. David Tkachuk : 
honourable senators , on the process in place , to which the minister has alluded in the last number of months on the APEC question , our side has always maintained that the responsibility of the commission is to investigate the actions of the RCMP during that affair . 
that is a process that neither the Leader of the Government in the Senate nor his government respects . 
therefore , when the minister speaks about the process , would he tell us how he expects the inquiry to deal with the questions of all the ministers in the government and the Prime Minister ' s Office ? 
senator Graham : 
i will not read the entire document . 
however , Ms Shirley Heafey specifies in the mandate : 
honourable senators , I have said repeatedly that the Chief of Staff to the Prime Minister and his former director of operations have voluntarily come forward and offered to testify . 
senator Kinsella : 
what about the Clerk of the Privy Council ? 
senator Graham : 
i am sure they will be prepared to testify in a very transparent way and answer all the questions that may be put to them by the commission and by the counsel for the commission . 
i have heard suggestions that certain other people should be asked to testify . 
honourable senators , it is up to the commission itself to ask individual witnesses to come forward . 
i understand that presently they have a list of 120 witnesses . 
i urge all honourable senators to allow the commission to proceed with its work as soon as it has a decision from the Federal Court . 
multiculturalism 
report of Auditor General on Distribution of Discretionary Funding - Government Position 
hon. Donald H . Oliver : 
honourable senators , my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate . 
it is a follow - up to a question that I asked the honourable leader two weeks ago in light of the report of the Auditor General . 
at that time I asked questions about the sections of the Auditor General ' s report that dealt with the way in which multicultural projects were being managed . 
in his response to me at that time the leader said : 
i am certain that the matters which he has noted and which have been referred to by Senator Oliver will be taken into consideration . 
should there be things which must be corrected , indeed , they will be corrected as quickly as possible . 
would the Leader of the Government tell us exactly what immediate short - term course of action will be taken to ensure that the discretionary funding is distributed in an appropriate manner from now on ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I thank the honourable senator for his question . 
the very same day on which he raised the question , I brought the matter to the attention of my colleague , the President of the Treasury Board . 
the government has not yet determined how it will proceed . 
as the honourable senator knows , the bill is at second reading in the House of Commons . 
the government is still examining its options with respect to what amendments , if any , may be considered . 
i do not believe the matter has yet been referred to committee . 
when it is referred to committee , the government will entertain amendments to the bill . 
when the bill arrives in this place , we will have our own opportunities to deal with the matter in whatever way the Senate determines . 
senator Oliver : 
honourable senators , the honourable leader is referring to Bill C - 44 which was not the subject of my question . 
however , in relation to Bill C - 44 , is the honourable leader stating that , to the best of his knowledge , the government ' s intention is to effect amendments to Bill C - 44 to ensure that the Race Relations Directorate is not gutted ? 
senator Graham : 
my understanding is that there may indeed be a reduction in the number of members on the board . 
i would be subject to clarification on this , Senator Oliver , but I understand that the present board membership is in the order of 20 . 
it may be reduced to 15 . 
however , I do not anticipate that its authority or its powers will be restricted or changed in any way . 
north Atlantic Treaty Organization 
discussions on Nuclear Weapons - Position of Minister 
hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate and pertains to NATO . 
when the comprehensive test - ban treaty discussions took place in this chamber , I supported Minister Axworthy ' s view that discussions should take place within NATO about NATO ' s nuclear strategy . 
however , I am concerned that a report in the newspaper , dated December 9 , indicates that the Minister of Foreign Affairs Lloyd Axworthy issued a strong call for nuclear disarmament , telling the United States , Britain and France that their warheads are far less important to alliance security now than during the Cold War . 
does this mean that Minister Axworthy does not believe there is any merit in discussions and that his mind is already made up ? 
does this not drive against the spirit of the usual practice within multilateral and regional associations that we put items on for discussion and not decide what we want to raise as we approach the table ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , there is no question that the government is examining this particular issue . 
he is examining the role of Canada , the mandate of NATO and our NATO allies with respect to nuclear weapons . 
canada remains committed to NATO . 
canada recognizes that nuclear weapons continue to play a role in the NATO strategic concept . 
as an active member of the alliance , however , Canada is currently participating in a review of the strategy concept . 
the review will address a wide range of issues , including the changed environment of European and Atlantic security . 
we expect and anticipate that the revised strategic concept will be ready to be issued at the NATO summit to be held in April . 
minister Axworthy has very strong views on these particular matters . 
i would assure the Honourable Senator Andreychuk that due consultations , as always , will be held . 
canada will be well represented by Minister Axworthy and his officials . 
possible New Strategy - Government Position 
hon. Roch Bolduc : 
honourable senators , my question to the Leader of the Government also concerns NATO . 
does the Government of Canada intend to take decisions that will have the effect of defining a new strategic concept for Canada - for example with Germany and other countries - and ignore our alliances with the Americans , the French and the British ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senator , that matter would be under consideration and would certainly not be addressed before consultations with our allies . 
aboriginal Peoples 
notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Meet During Sittings of the Senate 
leave having been given to revert to Notice of Motions : 
hon. Charlie Watt : 
honourable senators , I give notice that Thursday next , December 10 , 1998 , I will move : 
that the Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples have the power to sit at four o ' clock in the afternoon on Tuesday , for the balance of the present session , even though the Senate might then be sitting and that rule 95 ( 4 ) be suspended in relation thereto . 
visitors in the Gallery 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , before we proceed to Orders of the Day , I would draw your attention to the presence of some visitors in our gallery . 
they are a group of grandparents , fathers and mothers who are here to observe the tabling of the report of the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and the House of Commons on Child Custody and Access . 
on behalf of all senators , I bid you welcome . 
we are pleased to see Canadians here observing the work of the Senate . 
orders OF THE DAY 
business of the Senate 
hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I should like the table to call the bills in the order in which they are listed , with the exception of Order No. 5 , which I would like to have called last . 
hon. No ë l A . Kinsella ( Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , in light of the important tabling simultaneously in both Houses of the report of the Special Joint Committee on Custody and Access , perhaps we should advise the chamber that both sides have agreed that regardless of what order of business we are on at three o ' clock , we will revert to Presentation of Reports of Standing and Special Committees for the purpose of that tabling . 
senator Carstairs : 
if a senator is speaking at that time , we would like the senator to finish his or her speech , and then we will ask for permission to do that . 
hon. Lowell Murray : 
since we are discussing business of the chamber , does the Deputy Leader expect the Senate to adjourn by 3:30 today so that committees can proceed with their work ? 
senator Carstairs : 
senator Murray , we are doing our best to ensure that that happens . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , for my guidance , am I to interrupt the proceedings at three o ' clock ? 
senator Carstairs : 
no , Your Honour . 
senator Pearson will rise as soon as the person who happens to have the floor at three o ' clock finishes , at which time she will ask permission to table her report . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
is it agreed that as soon as the person who is speaking at three o ' clock finishes , we will revert ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
competition Act 
bill to Amend - Third Reading - Motion in Amendment - Debate Adjourned 
on the Order : 
resuming debate on the motion of the Honourable Senator Carstairs , seconded by the Honourable Senator Callbeck , for the third reading of Bill C - 20 , to amend the Competition Act and to make consequential and related amendments to other Acts . 
hon. Donald H . Oliver : 
honourable senators , at second reading debate on this bill , I spoke on the events leading up to its tabling and its purpose , that being to address the proliferation of deceptive telemarketing practices that prey upon consumers and cast a shadow over Canada ' s legitimate telemarketing industry . 
i also highlighted a number of other concerns , many of which were shared by interested parties , such as the Canadian Bar Association , the Retail Council of Canada , and the Canadian Chamber of Commerce . 
our committee heard the evidence of many witnesses . 
on third reading , these concerns remain outstanding and unresolved . 
the concerns can be categorized under two headings : the need for clarification and the need for consultation . 
the Canadian Bar Association stated in its testimony that three sections should be removed from the bill . 
b ) which may impose certain obligations on people or groups conducting legitimate lottery contests by means of telemarketing and , more important , create offences for those legitimate charitable organizations failing to comply with statutory requirements ; and the need to address inconsistencies between Bill C - 20 , which converts some criminal matters to civil reviewable ones , and other laws which do not permit the decriminalization of false or misleading representations . 
to begin with , the need to add the words " live voice " to the provision centres on the fact that : 
our sense is that technology has not got to the point where it can work sufficiently interactively with a human being in order to be used to misrepresent or defraud people ... we thought that that more clarity in the legislation would be desirable . 
these , honourable senators , are not my words but the words of the Retail Council of Canada which appeared before our committee on the first day of hearings on Bill C - 20 . 
another witness , Mr. Kennish of the Canadian Bar Association , Competition Law Section , also raised concerns before the committee . 
he said : 
in relation to inconsistencies that I see between section 206 of the Criminal Code and the proposed telemarketing provisions of Bill C - 20 , departmental officials stated before our committee the following : 
honourable senators , let me read you a section of the so - called minimal disclosure obligations referred to by the department officials . 
i ask you to consider them in relation to a charitable organization in your community such as a church or firefighters ' organization using telemarketing as a fundraising technique . 
no person who engages in telemarketing shall conduct or purport to conduct a contest , lottery or game of chance , skill or mixed chance and skill , where ... adequate and fair disclosure is not made of the number and approximate value of the prizes , of the area or areas to which they relate and of any fact within the person ' s knowledge , that affects materially the chances of winning . 
honourable senators , this is not a simple test . 
on the issue of whether or not an amendment is necessary to ensure legitimate charitable organizations are not unnecessarily subjected to new criminal offences , I further quote the department ' s response on the issue : 
there is 
... no need for an amendment to protect legitimate state authorized lotteries as disclosure requirements are minimal ... 
i am not alone in feeling the need to address the possibility of inconsistencies between Bill C - 20 , which converts some criminal matters to civil reviewable ones , and other laws which do not permit the decriminalization of false or misleading representations . 
the testimony before our committee demonstrated the problems of this provision in Bill C - 20 . I quote Mr. Ziegel , professor emeritus at the University of Toronto : 
... this is an important departure of policy and substance in the administration of the act . 
if it is going to be done , it ought to be done consistently across the many hundreds of welfare laws that we have at the federal level , not to mention in larger numbers at the provincial levels . 
but this act does not do it . 
in fact , there is a striking contradiction within Bill C - 20 because while it signals the conversion of these misleading advertising offences to mens rea offences so far as misleading advertising is concerned , it reinstates and introduces for the first time the telemarketing offences which is subject to the old regime of strict liability . 
that makes no sense to me at all . 
it seems to me as if the drafters of the act were given two conflicting sets of instructions . 
that alone would , I think , require explanation and justification . 
i have heard none , nor do I know of any reason why we should have one set of standards in the Competition Act so far as criminal prosecutions are concerned and a different set so far as other acts such as the Food and Drugs Act , Coinage Act , Safety Standards Act and so forth . 
... i also note that so far as the new section 52 is concerned , it has a number of other objectionable features . 
honourable senators , clearly this liability regime is a hybrid one , and requires further consultation and study before we move away from strict liability and inadvertently find ourselves in a position of not being able to prosecute those individuals which this bill targets . 
i now want to deal with the two other major concerns , one relating to wiretapping and one to whistle - blowing . 
a wiretap is one of the most invasive tools available to the state to investigate the activities of its citizens . 
honourable senators , the wiretap provision of Bill C - 20 was not included in Bill C - 67 , which died on the Order Paper , and it was not subjected to the same level of consultation as other amendments in this bill . 
as the Canadian Bar Association stated in its accompanying brief : 
section 45 of the Act , which creates the offence of conspiracy , uses broad language that potentially covers a variety of legitimate arrangements among competitors such as joint ventures or strategic alliances . 
as such , the potential scope for wiretap authorizations is great ... expanding its availability should not be done without extensive public consultation . 
honourable senators , the public consultations leading up to the other provisions contained in Bill C - 20 were indeed extensive , beginning with a June 1995 discussion paper and ending in April 1996 with a consultative panel report . 
this was not the case with the proposed amendment to allow wiretapping : judicially authorized interception , without consent , of private communications . 
in response to concerns on this issue , departmental officials stated the following : 
there was a more traditional consultation done with a range of stakeholders . 
let me explain to this chamber what is meant by a " more traditional consultation , " and again I quote from the Canadian Bar Association : 
... in the recent discussions on this topic , 
s the stakeholders were asked to keep the contents confidential , 
s only a few stakeholders were consulted , and it cannot be said it was representative of all stakeholders and 
the Canadian Chamber is adamantly against a proposed amendment to the Competition Act ... that would extend Criminal Code wiretapping authority to certain investigations conducted by the Competition Bureau . 
the amendment , as drafted , creates a scenario in which business people engaged in legitimate talks on strategic alliances and mergers could find themselves targets of wiretaps . 
Terence Corcoran also raised a number of arguments against this particular provision in various columns published in The Globe and Mail , and I extract for the consideration of the chamber just one , and I quote : 
this is more likely to increase the number of legitimate business people turned into suspected criminals . 
like many members of the Senate , I do not take much comfort in the words of departmental officials responding to the extensive powers granted by the government unto itself : " The cost of wiretap is a practical limit . " 
the Canadian Bar Association believes : 
honourable senators , clearly it is incumbent on all members of the Senate to ensure that this provision is not proclaimed until the government has undertaken to consult Canadians in a manner that is both transparent and open . 
following such consultation , it may be painfully obvious that the legislation must be amended to protect the rights of Canadians . 
last , I wish to address perhaps the most abhorrent provisions of the bill , the whistle - blowing provisions , not because the intent is wrong but , as pointed out before our committee , it is misguided and provides a prospect for criminal sanctions being imposed on an employer in respect to otherwise completely lawful behaviour . 
the whistle - blowing provisions were introduced during the Industry Committee hearings , and accordingly were not part of the same public consultation process as the other provisions of the bill . 
the Canadian Bar Associated states : 
section 66.1 would require the Commissioner of Competition to keep confidential the identities of persons who notify the Commissioner that they have reasonable grounds to believe that another person has committed or intends to commit an offence .... 
employers are also prohibited from the above employment actions if they believe an employee will undertake the above whistle - blowing actions . 
i should like to read one paragraph from the letter from the Canadian Bar Association that was sent to the Chairman of the Standing Senate Committee on Banking , Trade and Commerce . 
page 4 , paragraph 6 reads as follows : 
employers should not be required to continue to deal with employees or contractors in whom they have lost confidence . 
an employee ' s complaint to the Commissioner will generally sour the work environment . 
an employer acting in good faith should be entitled to terminate an employee either with notice or damages in lieu of notice . 
this legitimate action by an employer would no longer be available because section 66.2 would create a criminal offence for this conduct . 
further , the Canadian Bar Association said : 
the Dubin Report concluded that there was no need to amend the Competition Act to protect employee whistleblowers because protection is available through existing processes . 
the Dubin Report also found that whistleblower legislation in other jurisdictions has had little impact . 
there are significant problems in both the concepts and the drafting of section 66.2 . 
these problems will create unnecessary and difficult situations for employers . 
in addition there are issues respecting section 66.1 that should be of concern to the Commissioner and the Competition Bureau . 
in questioning witnesses in committee , Senator Angus asked the Director of the Competition Bureau , Mr. Von Finckenstein , to give the bureau ' s position . 
Mr. Von Finckenstein answered : 
... the amendments were put forward not by me and not on our suggestion but by - 
a member of the House - 
... i am neutral on it ... 
i see the deterrent value ... on the other hand , I do not want to create something that is going to cause employers a lot of harm or interfere with normal employee relations or is going to cause me a lot of useless work . 
honourable senators , I think this statement is revealing in that this provision does not represent government policy but , rather , the initiative of a member of the other place without proper consultation or study . 
as stated earlier , when asked to express his views on the desirability of such legislation , Justice Dubin produced what is known as the Dubin report and concludes that the whistle - blowing provisions are not necessary because an employee would have rights under common law and employment status . 
honourable senators , this was recently confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada in the case of Wallace v. United Grain Growing Ltd. 
therefore , today the Senate has golden opportunity to show its true colours . 
it can act as a body of sober , second thought . 
it can deliberate on a major piece of legislation and ensure that rights of privacy of our citizens are protected . 
where draft legislation is intrusive and dangerous or eroding our basic fundamental rights , we can act by amending or defeating the legislation . 
we have done it before . 
indeed , sometimes the Governor in Council has strongly encouraged us to so act - in part at least because the other place often misses vital mistakes and inconsistencies . 
this time we must do it on our own . 
we must modify the failure of Bill C - 20 - a most intrusive piece of legislation . 
honourable senators , I will now move a motion to remove the wiretap provisions and the whistle - blowing provisions of Bill C - 20 , respectively . 
motion in Amendment 
hon. Donald H . Oliver : 
honourable senators , I move : 
that Bill C - 20 be not now read a third time but that it be amended : 
( a ) in clause 19 
( i ) on page 14 , by deleting lines 31 to 46 ; 
( ii ) on page 15 , by deleting lines 1 to 42 . 
( b ) in clause 47 , on page 39 , by 
( i ) deleting the heading before clause 47 and clause 47 ; 
( ii ) renumbering clauses 48 to 55 as clauses 47 to 54 and any cross - references thereto accordingly . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion in amendment ? 
hon. Catherine S . Callbeck : 
honourable senators , I rise to speak on Bill C - 20 and address the concerns of the Honourable Senator Oliver . 
the first area that the honourable senator talked about was " live voice , " and that it should be added to the definition of " telecommunications . " 
this definition of " telecommunications " is deliberately broad so as not to leave loopholes for deceptive telemarketers to exploit . 
it is clear that deceptive telemarketers are notoriously creative . 
it is common knowledge that communications technology is developing at a fast peace . 
adding the words " live voice " directly to the statute would remove the flexibility that is required to deal with these realities . 
the committee recommended that this issue be kept under review with a view to further amendments if and when necessary . 
as the honourable senator knows - and , as the officials from the bureau told us - this is being dealt with in the guidelines . 
the second issue that my friend raised was the inconsistencies between section 206 of the Criminal Code and Bill C - 20 . I am sure that all senators have , at one time or another , worked with charitable religious organizations . 
the committee - and certainly myself - has looked closely at the issues that adversely affect them . 
we heard testimony by the former senior federal criminal prosecutor from Montreal , who is now counsel to the Competition Bureau . 
he indicated that there is no conflict between Bill C - 20 and the Criminal Code . 
this bill has been reviewed by some of the brightest minds in Canada at the Department of Justice , who are experts in both criminal law and the conflict of laws . 
we heard testimony from members of the bar with expertise in telemarketing , who indicated that this option of the bar is far from unanimous . 
we also heard testimony from the Canadian Direct Marketing Association . 
as the honourable senators on the committee know , this association represents some of the largest corporations in this country , including Air Canada , the Bay , Bell Canada , and several banks . 
it also represents many major charities , such as the United Way of Greater Toronto , Easter Seals Society , and World Vision Canada . 
in testimony before the Standing Senate Committee on Banking , Trade and Commerce , in response to direct questions by Senator Oliver , the president and CEO , who happens to be a member of the Canadian Bar Association , indicated that he was , " satisfied with the directors ' explanation . " 
i do not believe that there is a conflict . 
i have listened to the assurance of the director and I believe that he understands it well . 
i do not think there will be a problem going forward with that . 
i suppose that we could get 50 lawyers in here to say that there is a conflict and another 50 to say that there is not . 
i am not a lawyer , but I know that certainly the majority of the charities and corporations - many of them represented by the Canadian Direct Marketing Association - agree with this legislation . 
i think it is time to give them what they want . 
the third issue is wiretapping . 
senator Taylor asked about this aspect yesterday . 
it is the most controversial aspect of the bill . 
besides the Canadian Bar Association , other organizations that represented business , communities and senior citizens , have insisted that such a technique is required . 
wiretap without consent has been available under the Criminal Code for years . 
there are many checks and balances against this intrusive mechanism . 
one of those safeguards is that authorization must be granted by a judge , who must be satisfied it would be in the best interests of the administration of justice to do so , that other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or are unlikely to succeed ; or , that the matter is so urgent that other investigative procedures would be impractical . 
honourable senators , some of the most compelling evidence we heard in the committee hearings was from senior citizens . 
a lot of our senior citizens have had their lives ruined by these telemarketing con artists . 
to give you one example , we heard from the Congress of Union Retirees of Canada . 
that organization was founded in 1993 in Toronto . 
its purpose is to knit the various organizations that have been formed among retired persons - that is , union members from across Canada whose unions were affiliates of the Canadian Labour Congress . 
since its founding , its membership has grown to 500,000 affiliated members and it is expected to reach 1 million members in the next two years . 
most of the members here have spent a great deal of their lives fighting for the civil and human rights that we enjoy today . 
they admit that they agonized over this issue of wiretapping . 
however , the vice - president of the Congress of the Union Retirees of Canada came before the committee and stated : 
we would like to commend the section of the bill that permits judicial authorization for interceptions of private communication in relation to conspiracy , bid - rigging and deceptive telemarketing . 
being the type of organization we are , we had to struggle with that because there is civil liberties on one side , but the common good , in our opinion , exceeds that . 
that , in a nutshell , is why we should accept this clause of the bill . 
the fourth question mentioned by the honourable senator related to whistle - blowing . 
certainly the Canadian Bar Association has had some problems with this proposed new set of provisions which provide protection for whistle - blowers . 
it will be a criminal offence for an employer to take retaliatory measures against an employee who has , in good faith and on reasonable grounds , either reported suspect conduct to the Competition Bureau or refused to participate in what could constitute illegal conduct . 
employers face no impediments to disciplining or firing an employee for legitimate reasons . 
in the event of a criminal prosecution , the burden of proof remains in the Crown to prove all the elements of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt . 
this is a group who , if anyone , should be concerned with this particular clause regarding whistle - blowing . 
they struggled with the issue but they decided to support the approach of the government in order to restore trust to the average Canadian . 
this can be seen in the testimony of Mr. John Davidson who is the president and CEO of the Canadian Direct Marketing Association . 
this organization represents many of the major organizations that are engaged in legitimate telemarketing , as well as other forms of information - based marketing which includes electronic commerce on the Internet . 
when the president and the CEO of the Canada Direct Marketing Association came before the committee , the following is what he had to say regarding the part of the legislation that deals with whistle - blowing : 
for internal purposes , although there is always some nervousness on a legislative provision that allow employees to potentially break commercial confidentiality , it is the view of our association that , on balance , this problem is serious enough to outweigh those concerns . 
therefore , we believe that the whistle - blowing provisions are extremely important . 
scam artists threaten and intimidate their own employees , not just their victims . 
we believe that this protection will encourage people to come forward and help the Competition Bureau uncover a lot of what we know is happening but cannot get a handle on . 
the committee heard from many groups who supported Bill C - 20 . particularly the deceptive telemarketing provisions . 
we had endorsements , for example , from consumer groups , the Canadian Consumer Association of Canada , the Public Interest Advocacy Centre , seniors ' groups such as the National Pensioners and Senior Citizens Federation , the Congress of Union Retirees of Canada , and the Canadian Association of Retired Persons . 
we also heard from government representatives such as the Alberta Minister of Justice and Attorney General , and the Ontario Minister of Consumer and Commercial Relations . 
we heard from non - governmental organizations such as the Royal Canadian Legion , as well as small and large businesses , including the Canadian Federation of Independent Business , the Association of Manufacturers and Exporters of Canada , the Canadian Council of Better Business Bureaus , the Food and Consumer Products Manufacturers of Canada , MasterCard Canada , and the Visa Canada Association . 
all of those groups are backing Bill C - 20 . The fact is that most business interests in legitimate telemarketing , including some of those who are members of the Canadian Bar Association , most certainly welcome the change . 
they support the government ' s overall aim in respect of the deceiptive telemarketing provisions of Bill C - 20 to attack and prevent criminal activity , while allowing legitimate telemarketing industry to thrive . 
it is extremely important that we give better protection to the those who are the victims of unscrupulous telephone scammers . 
Canadian consumers and Canadian businesses need these measures which will promote a healthier marketplace and provide more effective tools for competition law enforcement . 
if we delay passage of this bill , we will delay making some very important , very necessary improvements to our laws , changes that are widely desired . 
the matter of consultation was raised . 
this bill has certainly been extensively discussed and debated . 
it was analyzed in detail by the House of Commons Standing Committee on Industry , by stakeholders , and by the Standing Senate Committee on Banking , Trade and Commerce . 
it has been improved with amendments . 
it enjoys widespread support . 
it is important that the Senate pass Bill C - 20 as swiftly as possible so that Canadians and their economy may enjoy its benefits . 
on motion of Senator Tkachuk , debate adjourned . 
child Custody and Access Reform 
report of Special Joint Committee Tabled 
leave having been given to revert to Reports of Standing and Special Committees : 
hon. Landon Pearson : 
honourable senators , I have the honour to table the report of the Special Joint Committee on Child Custody and Access entitled , " For the Sake of the Children . " 
with leave of the Senate and notwithstanding the notice requirement in rule 97 ( 3 ) , I move that the report be taken into consideration now in order to enable me to say a few words . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
consideration of Report - debate adjourned 
the Senate proceeded to consideration of the report of the Special Joint Committee on Child Custody and Access entitled , " For the Sake of the Children , " tabled in the Senate on December 9 , 1998 . 
hon. Landon Pearson : 
honourable senators , it is with some relief , considerable satisfaction and real hope that I table the report entitled : " For the Sake of the Children " in the chamber today . 
i intend to speak to the content of the report tomorrow , and today I have only two messages about it . 
the first is to assure you that we have taken our mandate seriously , that this report is truly child - centred . 
the second is to tell you that all of our recommendations are aimed at the reduction of conflict in situations of divorce and at improving outcomes for children . 
no other interpretation is valid . 
tomorrow I will elaborate on these messages , and for the remaining few minutes today I would like to take the opportunity to express my heartfelt appreciation to all those who journeyed with me on this long and arduous voyage . 
honourable senators , just over a year ago , you gave us , the Special Joint Committee on Child Custody and Access , the terms of reference that launched us on the journey that led to the creation of the document that you have before you today ; a journey that took committee members deep into the heart of the human condition where relationships form and dissolve , and children weep . 
long days of listening to personal tragedies , stories of pain and grief and loss , were balanced by expert testimony about possibilities for change . 
we brought our own perspective to the task at hand , and we each had a great deal to learn . 
the Senate members of the committee were extraordinary . 
senator Jessiman made a great contribution to the hearings last spring with his astute and knowledgeable questioning . 
we missed him greatly when he had to leave us . 
senators DeWare and Cohen continued throughout , and were constant in their intelligent and compassionate participation . 
on our side , Senator Cools , who , with Senators Jessiman and DeWare , was one of the original catalysts for our study , brought her special knowledge of the issues and her unique style to the proceedings . 
senators Cook and Maloney came on later , but both brought a wealth of experience to the subject and were strongly supportive . 
i do not know how we could have managed without them . 
our Senate clerk , Cathy Piccinin , was quite simply splendid . 
members of the House of Commons also made a great contribution . 
my co - chair Roger Gallaway rarely missed a meeting , and often restored our sagging spirits with his special brand of humour . 
in the early months of the study , some of the other members had difficulty extracting themselves from conflicting committee responsibilities ; however , after we resumed our deliberations in September , a core group devoted hours and hours to working together to forge the recommendations that represent our collective best efforts to come to grips with this enormous problem . 
while there are a number of disputes , as one would expect from such a wide - ranging group of individuals representing five political parties and two houses of Parliament , there was always consensus about our mandate and about the primary importance of children . 
the dissenting opinions are over the ways in which we can most effectively respond to the best interests of children , not over whether there is a need to do so . 
of that , there is no doubt . 
to support the work of a parliamentary committee requires a host of individuals with a wide variety of skills , including translating at high speeds . 
on behalf of my colleagues and myself , I would express our profound appreciation to all of them . 
as for our researchers , Kristen Douglas from the Library of Parliament and her associate Ron Stewart are beyond praise . 
together they transformed mountains of testimony into readable summaries and sought out all the evidence they could find for us . 
it was an enormous task , and we cannot thank them enough . 
finally , I should like to say " thanks " to our Deputy Leader , Senator Carstairs , for her unfailing support of my work , and for her suggestion on the title for our report . 
honourable senators , it was you who sent the special joint committee on its way , you who asked us to look out for the children of divorce , and it is to you to whom we now return with our report . 
it is our profound hope that our recommendations , designed to reduce conflict and promote better outcomes for the children of divorce , will be accepted , understood and acted upon to create positive change for children ' s well - being . 
i would like now to ask that this item remain adjourned in my name so that I may complete my remarks tomorrow . 
on motion of Senator Pearson , debate adjourned .

DNA Identification Bill 
third Reading 
hon. Lorna Milne : 
honourable senators , I rise today to explain the excellent work that the members of the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs did on Bill C - 3 , respecting DNA identification and to make consequential amendments to the Criminal Code and other acts , and to thank the Solicitor General and the RCMP Commissioner for responding positively to our concerns . 
honourable senators , this bill represents new and groundbreaking legislation . 
during our nine meetings on this bill , it became apparent that many issues concerned your committee . 
while we recognize that this technology will enable law enforcement agencies to solve crimes and better protect Canadians , your committee also has many legitimate fears about how the privacy of individual Canadians could be intruded upon in unprecedented , and perhaps unintentional , ways . 
furthermore , the committee felt that strict monitoring must occur of any information that is released to governments or agencies outside Canada . 
in order to help us overcome our concerns , the Solicitor General and his officials , including the Commissioner of the RCMP , agreed in writing or in testimony to the following undertakings . 
second , the new bill will also give the Senate equal authority with the House of Commons to conduct the five - year review required under this present version of Bill C - 3 . 
various stakeholders will be represented on this committee , including the Office of the Privacy Commissioner . 
fourth , the Solicitor General agreed to have the regulations prepublished and available to both the Senate and the other place for comment and evaluation . 
fifth , the Commissioner of the RCMP will present an annual report on the operation of the DNA data bank to the Solicitor General which will then be tabled in Parliament by the Solicitor General . 
sixth , the new regulations will clarify the meaning of " DNA profile " contained in the bill to help address the concerns of your committee with the possibility of profiles being expanded and used for purposes other than law enforcement . 
seventh , your committee was very concerned by the highly sensitive nature of the information contained within the data bank and the certainty of rapid technological changes and advancement . 
in response , the Solicitor General agreed to consider including in the new bill a provision for parliamentary review of the act every five years . 
honourable senators , as I mentioned , your committee has serious concerns about this bill because of the many potential implications of this new technology . 
however , I must congratulate the Solicitor General and his officials for they acknowledged our apprehensions and responded by agreeing to many measures which helped to assuage our fears . 
for this , Minister MacAulay should be thanked . 
your committee looks forward to seeing his promises implemented . 
i should add that it was only because of these solid commitments that your committee agreed to pass the bill without amendment . 
my friends , we in the Senate also deserve a thank you on the solid work that was done here . 
the agreements reached between your committee and the minister will serve to protect the privacy rights of Canadians while giving law enforcement agencies an additional powerful crime fighting tool without any undue delay . 
yet again , the Senate has acted with sober second thought in the best interests of Canadians . 
hon. Jerahmiel S . Grafstein : 
honourable senators , I wish to take a few minutes to provide a different gloss on the formulation of this report because I think it is significantly different from others that we have had before us . 
as the chairman of the committee has just suggested , this bill sets out rules for taking samples to support identification issues on charges based on designated offences set out in the bill . 
these provisions are quite wide . 
it also creates a national data bank which will be under the purview of the Commissioner of the RCMP . 
after I first read this bill - and I am sure this same process occurred to other senators on both sides - I reviewed the evidence taken in the other place and became rather concerned that the issues of privacy had not been taken into account . 
we were given the argument that DNA , like fingerprints , is just another method of identification . 
however , as we looked into the testimony and as we dug into the issue of DNA , we found that the scope of DNA samples was more far reaching . 
as Senator Milne pointed out , in the future , it has wider scope than we even know today , and technology is moving ever faster . 
thus , we had to strike a balance between proceeding with the criminal justice system that would provide more efficient and scientific data to support charges on the one hand , and the pervasive and invasive threat to privacy that this bill , if left unattended , could open up , on the other hand . 
i along with the committee turned to the Supreme Court of Canada to take a look at recent decisions . 
we were confronted with a very serious dilemma . 
as we got into the evidence , and as our chairman pointed out earlier , we reviewed it with the department , with officials from the RCMP , geneticists , the Privacy Commissioner and , ultimately , with the Commissioner of the RCMP , as well as the minister . 
we were delighted that our concerns , which we tried to articulate through the course of the hearings , were identified , agreed to , and assented to . 
i think we have ended up with a very important improvement , although not in the bill itself . 
we asked that an advisory committee be set up , and our request was agreed to by the Commissioner of the RCMP . 
he agreed that this is a sea change in terms of scientific material in aid of the criminal justice system and that it should be dealt with in a delicate and careful fashion . 
we were delighted with the acceptance of that principle . 
i wish to commend senators on both sides of the chamber for the work they did in committee . 
they include Senators Moore , Joyal , Nolin , Andreychuk , Beaudoin and , of course , our chairman , Senator Milne , who had to ride herd on a rather idiosyncratic and opinionated group of senators to come to this happy conclusion . 
hon. John G . Bryden : 
honourable senators , the chair asked me not to speak because it probably would not be necessary . 
i was not going to speak except that Senator Grafstein left me off his list . 
senator Grafstein : 
i am sorry . 
i thank Senators Bryden , Fraser , P é pin , and any others who I may have forgotten . 
senator Bryden : 
honourable senators , as the sponsor of the bill I wish to make a couple of points . 
first , I should like to make a brief comment not on the substance of the bill but on what I believe was outstanding cooperation and organization by the chair , the deputy chair and the steering committee in moving this bill very carefully and thoroughly through the committee . 
i will not go through all of the concerns and all of the thank yous that really should be put out . 
our major concern was not letting this genie of our personal DNA - this huge amount of information about the human person - out into the public without sufficient restrictions from a privacy point of view . 
i did not know this before or I would have shared it with the committee . 
i was somewhat reassured today to learn that our concern relates to only 2 per cent of the DNA peculiar to human beings . 
it is a tiny percentage of that 2 per cent that contains the identifying factors . 
it is like a tiny bar code . 
the description is not particularly flattering , but perhaps it is comforting to realize that we share the other 98 per cent with baboons . 
hon. Serge Joyal : 
honourable senators , I would like to second my colleague ' s remarks about the exceptional work done in committee . 
i would also like to mention a vital aspect of our discussions , given that we will have the opportunity in the coming 18 months to deal with another bill . 
i would like to express the concern that remains in the minds of the majority of the members of the committee on the constitutionality of the permanent nature of the data bank . 
in its June 18 , 1998 decision , the Supreme Court of Canada spoke of the constitutionality of the voluntary provision of a DNA sample , and specifically on whether it was constitutional for law enforcement services , once they had taken a DNA sample , to use it for an investigation other than the one that applied to the accused directly . 
the court concluded that it was constitutional for law enforcement agencies to use the DNA samples voluntarily provided by the accused for other purposes . 
however , Bill C - 3 is silent on the voluntary transfer of DNA samples , but requires those found guilty of the series of offences listed in the bill to provide a sample . 
as Senator Grafstein pointed out , a doubt remains as to the constitutionality of this requirement . 
the former chief justice of the Court of Appeal released an opinion in February of this year , in which he stated : 
the evidentiary purpose is already met through existing legislation that allows police to obtain a warrant for the seizure of bodily substances from an individual believed to be a party to an offence . 
i would draw honourable senators ' attention to the following words : 
as for the banking purpose of the proposal , society ' s interest in solving crimes by extending the pool of contributors to the DNA bank to include all persons arrested or charged with a designated offence , does not sufficiently outweigh " the intrusive nature of bodily sample seizures . " 
in other words , several of us still have legitimate doubts that this bill - in spite of its quite praiseworthy purpose , that is , protecting society against so - called hardened criminals - is completely unconstitutional , since it compels them to provide a DNA sample to police when they have been found guilty of certain offences . 
i point this out because our neighbours to the south now have court rulings stating that this requirement is contrary to the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States , which is similar to Section 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Liberties . 
in this regard , I would like to quote a ruling handed down by the Superior Court of Massachusetts on August 12 , 1998 : 
compelling persons to submit to invasive searches without particularized suspicion violates both the state and federal constitutions . 
i do not claim that American law applies in the same way as ours , far from it , as we all know . 
i therefore urge honourable senators to support the bill at third reading . 
hon. No ë l A . Kinsella ( Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , at second reading I was pleased to rise in this place and support the principle of the bill . 
my principal reason for doing so was that I thought the minister had been able to strike the right balance in the bill . 
however , during the hearings conducted by the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that delved into the specifics of the bill , I was impressed that our colleagues were able to flesh out a number of problem areas in the details . 
the recommendations attached to this report from the committee are terribly important . 
i am glad we have it on the record and that we in this chamber are underscoring those recommendations . 
we expect that the commitments that we received from the minister at the hearings will be fully met as the next phase in providing the legislative framework for dealing with modern technology . 
we also hope that this will be done in a manner that is respectful of the rights and freedoms of Canadians . 
as a parliamentary footnote , I hope that our identification of the provision that a report is to be made to only one house of Parliament will assist the drafters in the Department of Justice to smarten up and recognize that legislation which is important to the good governance of our country may be held up . 
this chamber will no longer tolerate the failure to recognize that we are a bicameral system . 
accountability to Parliament means accountability to both Houses . 
as I indicated at second reading , I support the bill in principle . 
i am that much more in support given these recommendations that have come from the detailed study of the bill . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed . 
second Reading - Order Stands 
on the Order : 
resuming debate on the motion of the Honourable Senator Fraser , seconded by the Honourable Senator Ruck , for the second reading of Bill C - 40 , respecting extradition , to amend the Canada Evidence Act , the Criminal Code , the Immigration Act and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act and to amend and repeal other Acts in consequence . 
hon. No ë l A . Kinsella ( Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I will adjourn the matter , if that is appropriate , in the name of Senator Beaudoin . 
on motion of Senator Kinsella , for Senator Beaudoin , debate adjourned . 
royal Canadian Mint Act Currency Act 
bill to Amend - Second Reading 
on the Order : 
resuming debate on the motion of the Honourable Senator Ferretti Barth , seconded by the Honourable Senator Lucier , for the second reading of Bill C - 41 , to amend the Royal Canadian Mint Act and the Currency Act . 
hon. Terry Stratton : 
honourable senators , I rise to speak at second reading stage of Bill C - 41 . 
the bill makes several changes to the laws governing the mint and Canadian currency . 
most of these changes are not controversial , such as the technical change in the definition of a " circulating coin , " abolition of the mill as a unit of measurement , and the conversion of coin dimensions from imperial to metric . 
the bill , as originally introduced , did , however , contain two quite controversial measures . 
first , it would have taken away from Parliament the right to approve the issue or withdrawal of circulating coins . 
there may be arguments for and against keeping the penny , but surely this is a decision that in the end ought to be ratified by Parliament after hearing from the people of Canada . 
similarly , the final say on whether to replace the $ 5 bill with a coin - should that day ever come - ought to rest with Parliament . 
if the Royal Canadian Mint , which specializes in coins , were allowed to decide whether we ought to have $ 5 coins , $ 10 coins or $ 20 coins , we would all become lopsided from the amount of coins we would have to carry . 
that would be a disservice to Canadians . 
we were pleased with the government ' s acceptance of my party ' s amendment to strike those clauses from the bill . 
the second contentious area concerns those provisions which will expand the borrowing authority of the mint from $ 50 million to $ 75 million . 
the problem is not the amount . 
the problem is that this new borrowing authority has focused attention on what the mint did with its existing authority . 
the mint is building a new $ 30 - million facility in Winnipeg that will put it into the coin plating business in direct competition with Westaim , a private sector company in Fort Saskatchewan , Alberta . 
work on that plant is nearing completion . 
the mint had enough borrowing authority to build this plant but , having used its borrowing authority , does not have enough to handle future needs with comfort . 
if this new venture is a flop , future borrowing needs could very well arise from the resultant start - up , inventory and marketing costs . 
had this facility not been built , there would be no need for additional borrowing powers for some time . 
honourable senators , this expansion does not make sense . 
although this facility is in my city of Winnipeg , it makes no sense to create government jobs in one city at the cost of private sector jobs in another . 
the mint currently buys its plated coins from Westaim , a privately owned corporation that employs 110 Canadians in Fort Saskatchewan , Alberta . 
it is not usual for me to defend Albertans , but in this case I think it is necessary , for the sake of free enterprise if nothing else . 
the mint did not need to build this plant . 
it could have continued to get its blanks from Westaim . 
not only will Westaim lose the mint as a customer ; it will have to compete with the mint for foreign contracts . 
government ought not try to run private business out of the marketplace for something that may or may not benefit its own bottom line . 
the mint ' s role is to produce coins , not to force private firms to compete with the bottomless resources of government . 
this is unnecessary empire building . 
any assertion on the part of the government that this will cost taxpayers nothing is pure nonsense . 
even if this venture succeeds , the jobs created in Winnipeg will be at the expense of jobs in Fort Saskatchewan . The dividends that the mint may be able to pay to the government will be at the expense of the tax revenues from Westaim . 
if the mint were a private company , it may have been refused a loan for this project because the business case was very weak . 
second , beyond the overcapacity issue , the mint is being sued by Westaim for patent infringement . 
honourable senators , try getting a bank loan to enter a new line of business if a court jeopardizes your ability to profitably produce a product for which there is an oversupply . 
then again , you and I would not be going to the bank with the guarantee of the Government of Canada behind us . 
because of a strange quirk in our patent laws , the government does not need anyone ' s permission to use any patent it wishes , as long as it agrees to pay licence fees . 
in this case , the mint is refusing to pay a licence fee , hence the lawsuit . 
since it is owned by the government , the mint feels that it can tread upon someone else ' s intellectual property rights . 
if the government wanted to get into this business , why did it not attempt to buy a patent licence from Westaim ? 
in closing , I should like to remind honourable senators opposite of their " getting government right " policy . 
under " Role of Government " there is a test that asks whether there is a legitimate and necessary role for government in this program area or activity . 
government witnesses who appear before the National Finance Committee should come prepared to explain how the expansion of the mint into a business line already being carried out by the private sector meets this test . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
motion agreed to and bill read second time . 
referred to Committee 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , when shall this bill be read the third time ?

Nunavut Act 
bill to Amend - Second Reading - Debate Adjourned 
honourable senators , I am happy to launch the debate on the motion for second reading of Bill C - 57 , to amend the Nunavut Act with respect to the Nunavut Court of Justice and to amend other Acts in consequence . 
honourable senators , the creation of the Territory of Nunavut in less than four months will mark a very important milestone in Canada ' s history . 
the creation of Nunavut fulfils the aspirations of the Inuit people in the eastern Arctic , who , for 25 years , have yearned to shape and determine their own future . 
honourable senators , before outlining the main elements of Bill C - 57 , I would like to explain the context in which the bill was drafted . 
the 1993 Nunavut Act provides for the creation of two separate trial courts in Nunavut : a territorial court and a superior court . 
honourable senators , last spring , Bill C - 39 , to amend the Nunavut Act and the Constitution Act , 1867 , proposed a number of amendments specifying how the two - level trial court system in Nunavut should work . 
in introducing Bill C - 39 , the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development announced that another bill , dealing with the judicial system , would be introduced later in the year . 
honourable senators , Bill C - 57 is the bill in question . 
it is the last major piece of legislative structuring the federal government has undertaken with regard to Nunavut . 
bill C - 57 proposes the implementation of a single - level trial court for Nunavut . 
it is important for honourable senators to know that Bill C - 57 is not an Ottawa - based initiative but is , in fact , a response to a request from the leaders of the North to implement a single - level trial court for Nunavut . 
interest in the single - level trial court has existed for some time in the Eastern and Western Arctic . 
following a conference in Iqaluit in November 1997 , which was organized by the interim commissioner for the Nunavut and attended by northern officials and members of the northern legal community , including a large number of northern justices of the peace and court workers , the Minister of Justice was asked by the interim commissioner , the Government of Northwest Territories and Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. - the corporate representative of the Inuit of the Eastern Arctic - to introduce legislation in the House of Commons to implement a single - level trial court for Nunavut . 
bill C - 57 is the government ' s response to that request . 
honourable senators , I would now like to outline the main features of Bill C - 57 . 
in Canada ' s other administrations , there are two levels of trial court : the provincial or territorial court , often referred to as the lower court , and the superior court of the province or territory . 
neither of these courts has legislative jurisdiction to hear all the cases from a given community . 
in the case of Nunavut , Bill C - 57 proposes combining these two levels of court into a single - level trial court , to be known as the Nunavut Court of Justice . 
the reason for this change is as follows . 
legal services in the western Arctic are provided by an itinerant court ; the judges , lawyers and clerks travel from one distant community to another . 
on average , each trial court visits a community only three or four times a year . 
there may therefore be significant delays between the time a charge is laid and the time a final decision is handed down with respect to guilt or innocence or , in family law cases , with respect to custody . 
these delays can have a devastating effect on the parties and can lead to discord within a community until the matter is resolved . 
honourable senators , Bill C - 57 proposes to implement for Nunavut a single - level trial court that will be able to deal with all matters on the court docket , whether serious or minor , whether civil , family or criminal in nature . 
by implementing this change , the people of Nunavut hope to obtain a court system for their territory which will be more efficient , will reduce the number of court circuits and will also have a positive impact upon reducing delay for parties before the court . 
honourable senators , I must emphasize the importance of timing for the adoption of Bill C - 57 . 
the new court it proposes can become a reality for the people of Nunavut only if the bill is passed well before April 1 , 1999 . The population of Nunavut must be given sufficient time to put into place the infrastructure a new court system requires . 
honourable senators , it is important to point out that , throughout development of the legislation creating this new court for Nunavut , a high degree of consultation and cooperation was established between the federal government , the government of the Northwest Territories and the representatives of Nunavut . 
a task force was mandated to coordinate the drafting of the federal and territorial legislation , and to ensure ongoing feedback on policy choices in the bill . 
the task force was composed of employees of the interim commissioner ' s office , particularly from the new Nunavut Department of Justice , representatives of Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated , and employees of the Government of the Northwest Territories , the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , and the federal Department of Justice . 
the officials of the Department of Justice also consulted the judiciary and members of lawyers ' associations in the north along with the legal and academic communities in the south to make sure that the new court was geared to the needs , traditions , culture and circumstances of the people of Nunavut . 
honourable senators , I would like to highlight some of the main themes of Bill C - 57 , because they bring out the unique aspects of the Nunavut Court of Justice . 
as I mentioned earlier , one of its most important characteristics requires , unlike in other jurisdictions in Canada , that its judges have jurisdiction to hear all cases . 
an amendment to the Nunavut Act provides that a judge of the Nunavut Court of Justice may exercise all the powers and functions of a representative of the judiciary under all laws in effect in Nunavut . 
moreover , amendments to a separate part of the Criminal Code provide that a judge of the Nunavut Court of Justice will have all powers and functions of all the representatives of the judicial authority provided in the Criminal Code . 
consequently , a judge of the Nunavut Court of Justice flying to a remote community may hear all cases , regardless of their seriousness , in a single circuit court . 
the complementary territorial legislation will also permit a judge to try all kinds of cases , in both family and civil law . 
this feature of the Nunavut Court of Justice should speed up the trial process and make the court more efficient . 
in this regard , I should point out that the accent on speed and the increased potential for resolving disputes within the community will contribute largely to reducing the negative consequences of a crime on the victims and the witnesses . 
faster resolution of pending charges will also help small communities heal the wounds left by crime and prevent the accused from suffering undue prejudice due to delays . 
another important aspect of the new court arises from the fact that the Nunavut Court of Justice will have the jurisdiction of a superior court . 
because of the requirements of dispensing justice in the north , the judges of the Nunavut court will necessarily perform most of the duties normally assigned to other representatives of the judicial system . 
these judges will , moreover , be superior court judges with all the powers of that position . 
since these judges will be living in Nunavut , with frequent contacts with the various Nunavut communities , the new structure will provide the court with the opportunity to have closer ties to the community and will afford the judges a better opportunity to become familiar with the communities , and vice versa . 
i expect the people of Nunavut will have a better perception and understanding of the justice system , since they will have the feeling that their cases are being heard by judges who are very familiar with their culture , their values and their needs . 
honourable senators , it pleases me that the amendments to the Criminal Code to enable the creation of a single - level trial court do not in any way restrict the rights of those who will appear before that court . 
this commitment to equity is , for instance , reflected in the provisions relating to appeals , as well as in the new arrangements the bill creates . 
bill C - 57 , honourable senators , will preserve the present scope of the right to appeal both summary conviction charges and indictments , in all criminal proceedings in Nunavut . 
there are also provisions in the bill to create a new method for the review of major decisions in criminal law . 
the principal purpose of this is to preserve the substantive and procedural rights of parties appearing before the courts in a structure with provision for a single - level trial court . 
the government has made a commitment to ensuring that the people of Nunavut have no fewer rights than those in other parts of the country simply because they have called for a single - level court system . 
finally , Bill C - 57 will implement the necessary amendments to the Judges Act so that Nunavut will have a single - level trial court at the superior court level . 
the proposed amendments provide for three superior court judges on the Nunavut Court of Justice . 
as I mentioned , all three will reside in the territory . 
with respect to the appointment of judges to this court , the Minister of Justice has already promised to find competent , experienced candidates truly committed to northern issues . 
we all know that the hon. minister has promised to consult the people of Northern Canada in order to ensure that the appointments reflect the unique needs , culture and conditions of Nunavut . 
the Department of Justice is committed to working closely with the Interim Commissioner of Nunavut , Nunavut organizations , and the new Nunavut government , when it is established , to help further adapt the justice system to the needs of Nunavut . 
the people of the North therefore expect that , with appropriate training , justices of the peace will gradually assume more responsibility for less serious matters in the communities they serve . 
the training of justices of the peace is , of course , a territorial responsibility , but the Minister of Justice has promised to do everything possible to help the new territory carry out this important task . 
it will be particularly important that these appointments ensure that the people of the eastern Arctic , who have always been underrepresented in criminal justice institutions , have an opportunity to participate fully in the life of these institutions . 
the appointment of Justices of the Peace will be within the jurisdiction of the new Government of Nunavut . 
i am confident that all efforts will be made to ensure that the Justices of the Peace who will be appointed will reflect the diversity of interest and experience in Inuit society . 
in particular , it will be important for these appointments to give a voice to those who have traditionally been under - represented in criminal justice institutions in the Eastern Arctic . 
honourable senators , the creation of a single - level trial court brings with it high hope for a court structure that is more responsive to the needs of the people of Nunavut . 
the new system proposed in Bill C - 57 is unprecedented and there will be a need , therefore , to monitor and evaluate the system in the years ahead to ensure that it has achieved the objective of providing an efficient , effective and accessible justice system . 
the Department of Justice is working with the Interim Commissioner ' s Office to design a monitoring and evaluation system to identify problems and possible changes to the court system which might be needed . 
we are at the dawn of a new era in Canada ' s history . 
we are all looking forward with enthusiasm to the creation of a new territory and we all want to play a role in the creation of a new tribunal that the people of Nunavut hope will be the best means of meeting their needs . 
i remind honourable senators , however , that the new court structure for Nunavut proposed in Bill C - 57 will not come into existence unless Bill C - 57 is passed well in advance of April 4 , 1999 . 
in closing , I thank honourable senators for their attention and I ask them to support the speedy passage of Bill C - 57 . 
on motion of Senator Kinsella , for Senator Andreychuk , debate ajourned . 
national Parks Act 
bill to Amend - Third Reading - Motion in Amendment - Vote Deferred 
on the Order : 
resuming debate on the motion of the Honourable Senator Butts , seconded by the Honourable Senator Milne , for the third reading of Bill C - 38 , to amend the National Parks Act ( creation of Tuktut Nogait National Park ) , 
and on the motion in amendment of the Honourable Senator Adams , seconded by the Honourable Senator Corbin , that the Bill be not now read a third time , but that it be referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples for further consideration . 
hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I am pleased today to rise to join in the debate on the motion by Senator Adams to refer Bill C - 38 to the Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples for further study . 
it is clear that every senator , including Senator Adams , is in favour of establishing a park in the North called " Tuktut Nogait National Park . " 
senator Adams is clearly in favour of developing a park in the region of the Inuvialuit people . 
the establishment of this national park has involved a long and very extensive and public process . 
the original idea for the park actually came about in 1989 , when the community of Paulatuk came to the federal government and requested the establishment of a national park as the best means of protecting the caribou calving grounds . 
i give a great deal of credit to the Standing Senate Committee on Energy , the Environment and Natural Resources under the leadership of Senator Ghitter which spent 14.1 hours and heard from 18 witnesses in the study of this bill . 
the committee heard from a large variety of groups and individuals who requested an appearance . They 
heard from the stakeholders , including the secretary of state for parks , the Honourable Andy Mitchell , as well as aboriginal organizations , environmental groups , geologists and the mining company involved . 
following this extensive study by the committee , the bill was reported back to this chamber without amendment . 
honourable senators , it is clear that there remain some issues of grave concern regarding the creation of this national park . 
we are sensitive to the issues raised by Senator Adams respecting the creation of this park and the impact that might have on members of his community and the community of the Inuvialuit people . 
this afternoon , honourable senators , the Honourable Alasdair Graham , Leader of the Government in the Senate , received the following letter from the minister responsible for the parks , the Honourable Andy Mitchell . 
i will table it as soon as I receive a French translation , which I I understand is on its way . 
it will then be tabled for all members of the chamber to read . 
hon. No ë l A . Kinsella ( Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
what is the date of the letter ? 
senator Carstairs : 
the date is December 9 , 1998 . It reads : 
dear Senator Graham : 
the review of the Tuktut Nogait legislation ( Bill C - 38 ) has underlined the need to ensure in our Arctic national parks that mechanisms and processes are in place to foster and build on the relationships and benefits of these special places . 
we are appreciative of the work undertaken by the Senate Standing Committee on Energy , Environment and Natural Resources . 
parks Canada is proposing the following actions to respond to some of the broader issues that came forward during the committee ' s review . 
Firstly , it is our intention to put in place in Parks Canada an Aboriginal Secretariat that will provide a focus and a single point to work with aboriginal people across Canada . 
the secretariat will be headed by a senior official in Parks Canada and will report directly to the Assistant Deputy Minister . 
secondly , working with the existing management board for the Tuktut Nogait National Park , we intend to create a process to address the issues of how the park can best contribute to the economic development of the community . 
as part of this process , we intend to accelerate our rate of investment in the park , by making available $ 2 million in the next fiscal year . 
Thirdly , we would propose that the Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples conduct a study addressing ways to improve co - management practices in existing Arctic parks and to examine ways to expand the economic opportunities associated with these parks within the parameters of existing agreements , and adhering to the principles of the National Parks Act . 
the Senate has played an important role in the establishment of Tuktut Nogait National Park , and I wish to thank you and your colleagues for your efforts . 
yours sincerely , The Honourable Andy Mitchell , Secretary of State ( Parks ) . 
honourable senators , I would be the first to indicate that this will not meet all the concerns raised by senators on both sides of this chamber . 
through the efforts of the last couple of days , though , many of the aspirations of the people of the North have been addressed in this particular letter . 
it is my recommendation that we do not refer Bill C - 38 to the Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples for further study but that we proceed with the vote , first , of course , on Senator Adams ' motion , unless it is withdrawn , and then on the bill itself . 
senator Kinsella : 
honourable senators , may I ask a question to the honourable deputy leader ? 
first , would you just repeat the part of that letter that speaks to the mechanism of a committee and the line of reporting ? 
if I heard correctly , the committee was to report to an assistant deputy minister . 
in the machinery of government , an ADM is a fairly low - level manager . 
he is not at the level of an associate deputy minister , nor is he at the level of a deputy minister . 
would the deputy leader clarify the level of the official mentioned in the letter ? 
senator Carstairs : 
honourable senators , clearly it would be much easier if this letter was in front of you and I regret that . 
i have been waiting for the last hour and a half for the French copy . 
senator Kinsella : 
that is from a minister of the Crown . 
senator Carstairs : 
it seems you have confused two paragraphs . 
for purposes of clarification , let me repeat them : 
Firstly , it is our intention to put in place in Parks Canada an aboriginal secretariat that will provide a focus and a single point to work with Aboriginal people across Canada . 
this secretariat will be headed by a senior official in Parks Canada and will report directly to the Assistant Deputy Minister . 
with respect to the work of the Senate committee : 
Thirdly , we would propose that the Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples conduct a study addressing ways to improve co - management practices in existing parks and to examine ways to expand the economic opportunities associated with these parks within the parameters of existing agreements and adhering to the principles of the National Parks Act . 
it would be my understanding that that report would go directly to the minister . 
senator Kinsella : 
this letter is signed by whom ? 
senator Carstairs : 
it is signed by the Honourable Andy Mitchell , Secretary of State ( Parks ) . 
senator Kinsella : 
honourable senators , we do not have a letter from the Minister of Canadian Heritage who is the minister responsible and who speaks on behalf of the government . 
to what extent can the letter be seen to be speaking for the Government of Canada in stating that there would be some continuance of this policy beyond the tenure of a junior minister ? 
senator Carstairs : 
honourable senators , the answer to that question is somewhat muddy . 
obviously , ministers can be changed at any time . 
we are all aware of that . 
however , the responsibility for the parks falls directly under the Secretary of State for Parks , but he in turn responds to the Minister of Heritage . 
it is my understanding that the Minister of Heritage is aware of this letter and supportive of it . 
hon. Ron Ghitter : 
honourable senators , it is my recollection of the testimony that the government was committed to $ 10 million by way of payment for this park . 
senator Carstairs : 
Yes. 
senator Ghitter : 
senator Carstairs : 
that is a correct assumption . 
senator Ghitter : 
honourable senators , aside from shifting the money around a little quicker , the deputy leader has not really dealt with the main issue . 
perhaps I misunderstand the letter . 
the main issue for the neighbouring local groups is the opportunity which the mine might provide . 
you have not addressed that at all . 
you have basically said to the people in the north country , " Here is $ 2 million . 
please go away and forget about your mine , which may be another Voisey ' s Bay , and forget about the economic benefits of that mine . 
here is $ 2 million . 
forget the fact that you may have a mining discovery , sitting within that little 2.5 per cent which may amount to another Voisey ' s Bay , which may be bigger than Sudbury . " 
is that what the government is saying in this letter ? 
do you expect the people of the North to buy into that ? 
is that what we are being led to believe ? 
senator Carstairs : 
honourable senators , I do not think the letter purports to do anything except what the letter says . 
let me be very clear here . 
no one has indicated that the people of the North should go away . 
that is their land . 
they live on it and it is hoped they will get working opportunities . 
that has been clear through the testimony which I have read , and I have not read it all . 
i was not at every single meeting of the committee but I became latterly very interested in this piece of legislation . 
we have here a situation of probability . 
this could be a very successful mine . 
we tend to go to extremes sometimes and say that perhaps it could be another Voisey ' s Bay . 
there is no indication at this point in time that it will be a Voisey ' s Bay . 
the indication is that 80 per cent of the available mining area is already outside of the park . 
we are talking at the very most of a 20 per cent region within the park . 
i understand there is also a possibility that a tunnel could go beneath the park if necessary to extract the minerals . 
this letter does say , I think very clearly , that the jobs which would be associated with the development of the park will begin to take place much more rapidly than they would have in the earlier transition of the $ 10 million for the development of the park . 
that money will start flowing at the beginning of the next fiscal year . 
that , in and of itself , should provide jobs for that region . 
hon. Consiglio Di Nino : 
honourable senators , I have a follow up question . 
was the minister made aware that the native communities involved in this project requested that of the 28,000 square kilometres - that is bigger than many countries - 2.5 per cent of it be put aside for the purposes of potential commercial benefit . 
i agree that we do not yet know the outcome but this measure may be of great economic benefit to those communities , helping them regain some of their dignity and self - respect . 
was the minister made aware of that ? 
senator Carstairs : 
i can assure Honourable Senator Di Nino that the minister is very much aware of it . 
the development of this park has taken seven years in the negotiating phase . 
the park boundaries , as they exist , were the result of a compromise , as are all boundaries with all parks that are established . 
i know , for example , that Parks Canada was very desirous of having some land along the shoreline . 
nevertheless , the Inuvialuit people , quite frankly , were not willing to give Parks Canada land along the shoreline . 
the knowledge of what was available , including the potential of this mining area , led to the comprise . 
perhaps it was not known to the extent of knowledge available in 1997 , because of technology improvements , but certainly they had knowledge that there was potential mineral wealth in the region . 
that is why Darnley Bay , which was developing this mine , actually signed off its rights in this park area ; they signed them off as part of the negotiations and settlement . 
senator Di Nino : 
senator Carstairs : 
the boundaries were agreed to not just by Parks Canada but by all of the participants . 
senator Di Nino : 
that still did not answer my question . 
if the minister was made aware of the request , did the minister say " no " to the request ? 
senator Carstairs : 
the answer to that is , " Yes , he did say ` no ' to that request in order to preserve the integrity of the parks boundaries which had been negotiated , and that negotiated settlement was signed by all parties . " 
honourable senators , I have now received the French copy of the letter I quoted from earlier . 
could I have leave of the Senate to table the document ? 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
is leave granted to table the letter , honourable senators ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
hon. Willie Adams : 
honourable senators , the minister ' s letter does not say anything about my motion on Bill C - 38 . 
i am in your hands , honourable senators . 
i will not withdraw my motion , even if an extra $ 2 million is offered . 
i heard from the deputy leader that that is part of the $ 10 million . 
i am still concerned about the Inuvialuit . 
that little piece of property that Senator Di Nino asked about covers 28,000 square kilometres . 
that is a big property . 
there is a future for the people there in mining . 
i am in your hands , honourable senators . 
i am not withdrawing my motion . 
hon. John Buchanan : 
honourable senators , I have nothing against the creation of national parks . 
national parks are historic in this country ; they have served this country well . 
new national parks are very important , not only for the environment but also for the people in those areas . 
i speak , of course , about the Cape Breton Highlands National Park , Kejimkujik National Park , and areas like Louisburg and Gros Morne in Newfoundland . 
however , we have a much different situation here . 
i , for one , would be very upset if there were a move afoot to change the boundaries of the Cape Breton Highlands National Park . 
i would also be very upset if there were a move to change the boundaries of Kejimkujik . 
i am not upset by a movement by the people in this area to exclude 2.5 per cent of a 28,000 square kilometre park . 
why would I be upset if the boundaries of Kejimkujik National Park were to be changed ? 
the answer is that Kejimkujik is located in an area where all the trees could be cut down , and homes , and perhaps even office towers , could be built . 
many activities of that sort could take place in Kekimkujik National Park or in Cape Breton National Park . 
will there be homes built where this park is located in the Northwest Territories ? 
let us look at the facts here . 
i agree that it is their land . 
i do not agree with the deputy leader when she says that the boundaries have been determined , so we must proceed on that basis . 
the government says that the agreement was signed in 1996 . 
yes , that is true , but 99 per cent of the people now say that they want 2.5 per cent excluded because as many as 70 to 100 jobs may be created , in an area which has high unemployment . 
we have high unemployment in areas like Cape Breton , but nothing like the high unemployment in the area where this park is to be located . 
they have much higher unemployment there . 
who is in favour of the 2.5 per cent being excluded ? 
the Government of the Northwest Territories is opposed , as is the local government . 
the Government of the Northwest Territories definitely signed the agreement . 
contrary to what the Deputy Leader of the Government said , in 1996 they were aware of the potential of minerals in the area . 
however , a year later , using up - to - date technology , aerials surveys determined that indeed there was not a potential but a probability that the area in question contains a lot of nickel and other resources , and thus the potential for the creation of up to 100 new jobs , in an area where they are desperately needed . 
although that is true , the greatest potential exists within that 2.5 per cent which is at the western boundary of the park . 
who is opposed to this ? 
parks Canada . 
who is in favour of it ? 
the government of the Northwest Territories and those responsible for wildlife management . 
the biologists who appeared said that calving of Bluenose caribou may or may not take place in that area . 
in answer to a question which I posed , they replied that , if there is development in that 2.5 per cent , the law as it stands now will protect those calving grounds from any development . 
i , for one , certainly would not want to do anything that would harm the Bluenose caribou . 
after all , they probably come from Bluenose , Nova Scotia . 
honourable senators , I ask you to remember this . 
they are now asking Parks Canada to review this matter as provided in the 1996 agreement . 
the response from Parks Canada and Ottawa is that it is a done deal . 
the people of the area have said that they want the 2.5 per cent excluded . 
Jose Kusugak who represents Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. appeared before the committee . 
he also represents the people of the area . 
he pleaded with the committee . 
he told us that they need the jobs , and he asked us to exclude the 2.5 per cent of the 28,000 square kilometres . 
he represents a large group of people . 
Nellie Cournoyea , who I have known for many years from the premiers conferences , also pleaded : " Please do the right thing by the people . " 
i always remember this adage , honourable senators : 
the people may be wrong some of the time , but the people are right most of the time , not the bureaucrats in Ottawa . 
i used to say that some ministers of fisheries were excellent ministers of fisheries . 
when I sat in my provincial legislature , whether it was the Tories or the Liberals who were in government , I would say that most of the bureaucrats in Ottawa in the Department of Fisheries and Oceans were armchair fishermen telling the people of Nova Scotia , Newfoundland , New Brunswick and P.E.I. what must happen . 
many of them had never seen the Atlantic Ocean . 
we have a situation here in which the people have spoken . 
yet , the bureaucrats in Ottawa , Ontario , say , " It does not matter to us . 
we have set this agreement up . 
we have delineated the boundary lines . 
we will not change them . " 
everyone knows that when the bureaucrats in Ottawa determine what will happen in the Northwest Territories in opposition to the people of the area , democracy is going down the drain . 
we do not want that to happen . 
some Hon. Senators : 
hear , hear ! 
senator Buchanan : 
the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and read a letter in which there was not one mention of the major objection to this bill . 
all Minister Mitchell said was , " Let ' s vote on it and pass it . 
forget the people of the area . " 
that is what is happening here . 
i am told that there is 80 per cent unemployment in the area under discussion . 
no , we will not . 
some Hon. Senators : 
no ! 
senator Buchanan : 
i wish my dear friend Sister Butts from Cape Breton were here . 
she knows all about unemployment . 
senator Carstairs : 
she is a strong supporter of this bill . 
senator Buchanan : 
why has she decided to support this bill which will continue the high unemployment in the area ? 
in that regard , I would refer to section 22.1 of the Tuktut Nogait Agreement which provides for a review . 
that section states : 
what is happening here ? 
all the parties have not agreed . 
that is what has happened here . 
parks Canada has not agreed because they made the decision , and they will not back off from their decision . 
however , 99 per cent of the people in that area want the exclusion . 
they deserve the jobs . 
they deserve to be heard . 
i say again , the people represent the power in this country . 
ten million dollars has been spent and two jobs will be created . 
if the 2.5 per cent is excluded , will the two jobs still exist ? 
yes , they will . 
no jobs will be lost for the 2.5 per cent . 
we support the creation of the park , and certainly support the request of Senator Adams that the matter be referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples . 
what a simple concession for the Senate to make to Senator Adams and Senator Watt . 
the people must be heard . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
i regret to have to interrupt the Honourable Senator Buchanan , but his 15 - minute time period has expired . 
senator Buchanan : 
honourable senators , may I have leave to continue ? 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
is leave granted ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
senator Buchanan : 
thank you , honourable senators . 
the Senate will stand 10 feet tall in the eyes of the public if we do the right thing by the people . 
i have gained much respect for the Senate in recent years . 
we are here to represent the regions of Canada , particularly the poorer regions , and the minorities , and that is what we are talking about here . 
we are here to protect them from the bureaucracy ; in this instance Parks Canada . 
it is our job to represent the minorities of this region and to help create jobs for this region . 
we are the chamber of sober second thought . 
we are giving this matte second thought and we are protecting the people of the area . 
honourable senators , we support the needs of the people of the area . 
what do we have to lose by doing this ? 
there will be a delay of a few months , but that is about all . 
it is the right thing to do . 
we cannot go wrong if we support the people in a region that needs the support of the Senate . 
please vote in favour of the amendment of Senator Adams , as I certainly shall . 
hon. Eymard G . Corbin : 
i should like to make a comment and then ask a question of Senator Buchanan . 
throughout his speech he said that the Tuktut Nogait Park would be comprised of 28,000 square kilometres . 
i think that is a mistake . 
the park discussed in this bill is comprised of 16,340 square kilometres . 
as to the percentage that the Inuvialuit want withdrawn , he is right . 
they are talking about approximately 2.5 per cent , but 2.5 per cent of 16,000 square kilometres . 
since the addition of the Nunavut and Sahtu lands to the core of Tuktut Nogait is still under negotiation , is it the senator ' s considered opinion that if we do not accept Senator Adams ' request to send this bill to the Aboriginal Affairs Committee for further examination , and if Parks Canada will not sit down with the other five cosignatories of the agreement , current negotiations with regard to the addition of those lands will be more difficult ? 
senator Buchanan : 
honourable senators , the figure I used was the one I received from Senator Adams . 
in his speech he said : 
Tuktut Nogait Park covers an area of 16,340 square kilometres . 
another 11,660 square kilometres were given to the park by the Sahtu and Nunavut . 
the park would then cover an area of 28,000 square kilometres . 
that is the figure I was using . 
the boundary adjustment as proposed by Bill C - 38 is only 2.5 per cent of the park . 
senator Corbin : 
there is a misunderstanding . 
that is not the way I read the maps . 
senator Buchanan : 
perhaps Senator Adams could answer the question . 
i used the figures I found in his comments . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
i am sorry . 
there can be no questions of other honourable senators , unless leave is granted . 
senator Kinsella : 
leave is granted . 
hon. Senators : 
senator Buchanan : 
i may be wrong . 
i read that the area of the park would be 28,000 square kilometres . 
senator Kinsella : 
the committee can find the facts . 
senator Corbin : 
that is the ultimate proposal for the park . 
however , Bill C - 38 talks about in excess of 16,000 square kilometres , and that is what we are considering today . 
by the way , I read every word of the testimony heard by the committee . 
i am well informed . 
senator Buchanan : 
i am only saying that I used the figures given by Senator Adams the other day . 
the honourable senator may be right . 
however , 2.5 per cent amounts to a very small parcel of land in a 16,000 square kilometre park . 
senator Corbin : 
the 28,000 square kilometres to which the honourable senator is referring would be the final dimensions of the enlarged park . 
Tuktut Nogait is the core area we are dealing with here now . 
the addition of Nunavut lands and Sahtu lands would enlarge the park to a total of 28,000 square kilometres . 
is it the honourable senator ` s considered opinion that if we are not sympathetic to the request before us to have 2.5 per cent of the current proposed park removed , negotiations for the addition of more lands will be much more difficult ? 
senator Buchanan : 
honourable senators , that is absolutely my opinion . 
if the figure of 28,000 square kilometres is wrong , I accept that . 
i see now that Senator Adams ' figure of 28,000 included the 16,340 . 
the line that got me was that the boundary adjustment as proposed by Bill C - 38 is only 2.5 per cent of the park . 
what the honourable senator just said is absolutely right . 
hon. Herbert O . Sparrow : 
honourable senators , was it intended to distribute to members of the house the letter from the minister ? 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
the letter has been tabled . 
if there is a request for distribution , we will have copies made . 
senator Sparrow : 
how would I request that the letter be distributed ? 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
i shall ask the Table to make copies . 
if no other honourable senator wishes to speak , is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion in amendment ? 
some Hon. Senators : 
Yes. 
some Hon. Senators : 
No. 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
will those honourable senators in favour of the motion in amendment will please say " yea " ? 
some Hon. Senators : 
yea . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
will those honourable senators opposed to the motion in amendment please say " nay " ? 
some Hon. Senators : 
nay . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
in my opinion , the " nays " have it . 
and two honourable senators having risen . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , the whip on the government side has stated that he wishes the vote deferred until tomorrow . 
hence , the vote will be deferred to tomorrow at 5:30 p.m. in accordance with the Rules of the Senate . 
a Bill to Change the Name of the Electoral District of Stormont - Dundas 
second Reading 
honourable senators , this bill is fairly straight forward . 
it simply requests a change in the name of the electoral district of Stormont - Dundas to Stormont - Dundas - Charlottenburgh . 
demographics change over time . 
we have all gone through changes in the names of ridings over the years . 
i gather that others are suggested as well . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
if no other honourable senator wishes to speak , is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
motion agreed to and bill read second time . 
referred to Committee 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , when shall this bill be read the third time ? 
on motion of Senator Rompkey , bill referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs . 
a Bill to Change the Name of the Electoral District of Sackville - Eastern Shore

honourable senators , I could repeat word for word exactly what Senator Rompkey said a few moments ago .

a Bill to Change the Name of the Electoral District of Argenteuil - Papineau 
second Reading 
honourable senators , for the same reasons as my colleagues and following a review of the boundaries of the electoral district as requested by the sitting member , I ask my colleagues to support the passage of this bill . 
hon. Marcel Prud ' homme : 
honourable senators , very briefly , my remarks do not apply specifically to Bill C - 465 . 
in the future , a little more caution will be required . 
we accept these proposals with pleasure . 
it is difficult to refuse them . 
i sat 30 years in the House of Commons on bills under the Elections Act . 
people are always ready to change the name of , say , Dorchester Boulevard to Ren é - L é vesque Boulevard , without really knowing how much this change would cost . 
i am not criticizing these two bills . 
honourable senators , I am not opposed to these three bills to which we will give second and third reading , but there is an abuse when we arrive at three , four or five names . 
i had the occasion in the House of Commons to sit on the committee on the Constitution , the committee on the referendum and the committee on electoral boundaries and names . 
eventually , there will have to be a debate . 
i am talking about a principle for the future . 
we will soon have requests from people who will want to add two names to the list they already have . 
i said I would not put it to the Senate to find another sponsor because we will end up having electoral districts with five names . 
i know that it is good politically because we can please the electorate of one section and the electorate of another section . 
however , stand by for the next debate . 
since these bills are being sent to committee , I will put my views on the record at that time . 
senator Maheu : 
i have an answer for my colleague . 
senator Prud ' homme : 
no , that will not be necessary . 
senator Maheu : 
it is because Mirabel simply was not included . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , it is moved by the Honourable Senator Maheu , seconded by the Honourable Senator Losier - Cool , that this bill be read the second time . 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
some Hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
motion agreed to and bill read second time and passed .

the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , when shall this bill be read the third time ? 
the Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Mackenzie - Bill to Amend - Third Reading 
honourable senators , I defer to the Honourable Senator Atkins , who wishes to speak at this time . 
hon. Norman K . Atkins : 
honourable senators , I rise today to take part in this third reading debate on Bill S - 20 for two reasons . 
first , I wish to add my support to this bill . 
this is a bill to amend a corporate sole statute passed by Parliament in 1913 , which established the Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Mackenzie . 
by this bill , greater flexibility is given to the diocese when dealing with real estate and investments than was given in the original act . 
it is my belief that this is deemed desirable and necessary by the diocese . 
we should amend the statute accordingly . 
that brings me to my second reason for rising to speak today . 
the concept of the corporation sole as it is presently established is an acronym and should be changed . 
senator Kinsella : 
order , order ! 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , cell phones are not permitted in the Senate chamber . 
i ask the honourable senator who has a cell phone in this chamber to remove it immediately . 
senator Atkins : 
it is in someone ' s desk , Your Honour . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
confiscate it , then . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
you may now continue , Senator Atkins . 
senator Atkins : 
thank you , Your Honour . 
i believe that either through an addition to the Canada Corporations Act or through a separate and distinct statute dealing with corporations sole , a way should be found by which they can be incorporated or change their acts of incorporation through an administrative procedure . 
eventually , parliamentary involvement is no longer necessary . 
historically , the corporation sole was a device designed to solve the legal problems associated with the holy and ecclesiastical office and that office actually owning land and fixed assets . 
as a result of corporation sole , the church official , rector , bishop , et cetera , was considered to be a corporate entity and all property associated with the church was deemed to be owned by the corporation , not by the individual church leader personally . 
this facilitated the transfer of property as it was the corporation that owned it , not the individual clergy person . 
for example , on the death of the clergy person , the property would not go to its successors but would remain in the name of the diocese . 
unfortunately , at the present time , the Canada Corporations Act does not allow for the incorporation of this type of vehicle through administrative action . 
therefore , Parliament must deal with each specific amendment to existing corporate sole statutes and is the only vehicle for the incorporation of new corporations sole . 
i believe it is time we changed this method of incorporation . 
honourable senators , a number of states in the United States have enacted statutes which allowed corporations sole to deal with administration in an administrative fashion . 
the state of California has a corporation sole statute . 
it grandfathers all existing corporations sole . 
it also provides an administrative mechanism whereby new ones can be created and existing ones can be changed . 
it provides for their continued existence , powers , dissolution if necessary , and disposition of assets upon dissolution . 
it is time that we streamlined this procedure and adopted a similar statute in Canada . 
i propose to table a Private Member ' s Bill when we return after the Christmas break in order to establish a method by which these corporations can change or come into existence without constantly involving bills being introduced in the Senate . 
in the meantime , let me conclude by saying that I support Senator Taylor ' s Bill S - 20 . 
senator Taylor : 
honourable senators , in closing the debate , I wish to thank the house and Senator Murray ' s committee for the diligence in which they carried out their duties . 
i also wish to thank senators for giving us some reasons why we should be overhauling the process . 
however , that will have to begin in the House of Commons . 
there is nothing else that I wish to add at this point in time . 
thank you for your consideration . 
we are now ready for the vote ! 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , I rise not to correct the Honourable Senator Taylor but to ensure that people understand the procedure because there is a misconception here . 
closing a debate applies only to the second reading of a bill or the closing of debate on a substantive motion or inquiry . 
on third reading , there is no formal closing of debate . 
i merely say it at times because people expect it , but it does not exist . 
motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed . 
privatization and Licensing of Quotas 
consideration of Report of Fisheries Committee - Debate Adjourned 
the Senate proceeded to consideration of the third report of the Standing Senate Committee on Fisheries , entitled : " Privatization and Quota Licensing in Canada ' s Fisheries , " tabled in the Senate on December 8 , 1998 . 
hon. Gerald J . Comeau : 
honourable senators , I should like to open by reading the first quote in our report by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , the Honourable David Anderson , where he says : 
in the examination that your Committee is making , the Senate is very much fulfilling its traditional and extremely important role . 
over the past several months - 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , could we have some order , please , so we may hear the honourable senator give his speech ? 
senator Comeau : 
thank you , Your Honour . 
over the past several months , the Fisheries Committee studied privatization and quota licensing in Canada ' s commercial fisheries . 
we sampled a wide spectrum of opinion from Canadians on both coasts of Canada . 
we also heard experts through video conferencing from Iceland and New Zealand - countries said to be world leaders in privatizing their fisheries . 
the debate in Canada centres largely on giving fisheries operations some form of private ownership of fish stocks in the form of private quota fishing licences . 
these private quotas provide individual fishers or fishing companies with a right to harvest a certain quantity of fish annually . 
it is somewhat like a swimming inventory which they can dip into with their nets on an occasional basis . 
private quotas are a significant departure from the traditional competitive fisheries management approach , and the question of extending them stirs up strong emotions on both sides of the issues . 
fishers and fishing communities are divided on this issue . 
the privatization model is one that is enthusiastically embraced by classical economists , by neo - conservative theorists in think - tanks , and by certain newspaper columnists and editorial writers in the central region of Canada . 
the private - quotas approach is heavily promoted by the corporate sector of the fishing industry and has long - committed supporters within the federal fisheries bureaucracy . 
the privatization of fishing rights in Canada began in earnest in the early 1980 s . 
i should add that the process has been gradual , has taken place over several fisheries ministers , and has involved successive governments . 
for this reason , it is not necessarily a partisan issue . 
minister Anderson does not have an easy portfolio . 
these are difficult times in the fishery . 
canada ' s commercial fisheries are undergoing extremely severe changes . 
the mandate , programs and services of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans directly affect the lives and livelihoods of tens of thousands of people in freshwater and ocean fisheries . 
they also indirectly affect the lives of other people in many communities who depend on the fisheries . 
the federal government is now promoting what they call " comanagement " in the fishery . 
our committee does not wish to attach blame . 
in our report , we do not attribute ill intentions at all . 
that is misguided in this day and age when we want transparency and open government . 
the public has a right to be consulted , and the department has a responsibility to be open with what it calls its " game plan " - language that comes directly from working papers of the department . 
instead of being up front , the department is resorting to simplistic jingles and buzzwords like " too many fishermen chasing too few fish , " " a race for the fish , " and " free - for - all " and to using very fuzzy words like " efficiency . " 
our committee approached this issue with an open mind . 
we had no axe to grind . 
it was not our intention to propose solutions or even to choose sides in the debate . 
our intent was to ask questions . 
the positions on the issue seemed very polarized and there seemed to be no objective approach to the debate . 
we felt that our study would add a positive note to the debate . 
we wanted to provide a forum to discuss the issues , and we hope we have accomplished this . 
once honourable senators read the report , I am quite sure you will agree that we have done this . 
the report speaks for itself . 
the bottom line is that private quotas should be regarded as only one management tool to be used in conjunction with others , and not applied indiscriminately . 
in October , 1995 , Canada signed the United Nations Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries , section 6.18 of which states : 
recognizing the important contributions of artisanal and small - scale fisheries to employment , income and food security , States should appropriately protect the rights of fishers and fishworkers , particularly those engaged in subsistence , small - scale and artisanal fisheries , to a secure and just livelihood , as well as preferential access , where appropriate , to traditional fishing grounds and resources in the waters under the national jurisdiction . 
as a signatory to this convention and other UN agreements , the federal government has a duty to safeguard the interests of its small - boat fishing fleets . 
i would like to say a special thank you to witnesses for their valuable contribution . 
we had witnesses from Canada ' s East Coast and West Coast , as well as witnesses from New Zealand and Iceland who donated their time to help us . 
we were very impressed with the calibre of their presentations and their great credibility . 
their generosity of time , their candid testimony and their great knowledge and experience should give this report a long - lasting and useful shelf life . 
in closing , I would offer a special thanks to the committee members who devoted so much time and energy to this study . 
it was long and sometimes complex with technical testimony that sometimes boggled our minds . 
it was a privilege for me to serve with such devoted parliamentarians . 
all Canadians should be proud of their parliamentarians and what they accomplished by writing this report . 
thank you to you all . 
hon. Senators : 
hear , hear ! 
hon. John B . Stewart : 
honourable senators , I have three or four points - perhaps more - to make , but I shall try to make them briefly . 
i agree entirely with Senator Comeau that the governance of fisheries is an extraordinarily difficult task . 
that is true domestically and , as we see , it is increasingly difficult internationally . 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has my sympathy . 
senator Comeau explained to the house what individual quotas are . 
on the one hand , they are a technique designed to prevent a race to catch the fish that are out there in the sea , a race which can often be destructive and costly . 
on the other hand , quotas for a specific species can lead to highgrading . 
to allocate or privatize a certain quantity of fish is not like enclosing land . 
it is not comparable to the enclosure movement of the 16 th , 17 th and 18 th centuries in the United Kingdom because , first , fish move , and , second , they do not occupy distinct locales . 
therefore , if one is going out to catch one ' s quota of a particular species , one may very well catch fish of other species , and since one does not have a quota , one dumps the dead fish back into the ocean . 
that is bad . 
quotas , in a curious way , lead to excessive effort . 
if one assumes some form of quota system is going to be introduced , the people who want to ensure that they get a big quota go out and catch fish , even when the species is scarce , contrary to the stated aims of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans . 
then , when the quota system is brought in , they are rewarded for ignoring the minister ' s own conservation policy . 
so much for individual quotas . 
let me say a word or two about individual transferable quotas . 
individual transferable quotas are feared . 
why are they feared ? 
one fear is that the quotas will come under the control of foreign corporations . 
this is why , in the fishing communities , we have so much unease when we hear about the proposed Multilateral Agreement on Investment . 
to take a specific example , suppose some adventurous American corporation wanted to buy out National Sea Products . 
if the law allowed it , then that corporation , and all those who depended on it , would come under American direction . 
however , it is worse than that . 
when I put that point to some fishermen to see if I was right , they said that it could get worse than that : " Those companies might find some way of employing people who are not Canadians as their deckhands , and we would not even be proletarians . " 
that may be a fear which is unfounded but it is present . 
as Senator Comeau said , the committee had the advantage of hearing testimony from both Iceland and New Zealand . 
why was it important to have testimony from these two countries ? 
their experience with individual transferable quota has been held up to Canadians as models of how well individual transferable quotas work . 
however , we learned that the New Zealand experience has not been all favourable . 
the evidence is not all in favour of individual transferable quotas . 
the same is true in the case of Iceland . 
another thing that makes reference to these two countries as examples misleading is that their fisheries are very different from ours . 
they play a different part in the socio - economic structure . 
that is not true in Canada . 
we cannot take Iceland as the glorious model to be followed by Canada . 
i had hoped to ask the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans when he was with the committee to read the critical testimony that we have heard from Iceland , and from New Zealand , as to how ITOs operate in these so - called model countries . 
i have tried to analyse why there is so much suspicion of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans . 
i still do not know that I have the correct answer , but I have an hypothesis . 
in any case , let me put it before you . 
when we heard the minister a few days ago , he kept talking about " the industry . " 
when someone talks about " the industry " these days , one tends to think about that great buzzword " rationalization " and the even greater buzzword " mergers . " 
concentration is now the trend . 
every time a minister refers to the fisheries as an industry , that minister causes uneasiness in the fishing communities . 
ministers go ahead with their policies on the assumption that they are managing an industry . 
however , the fisheries are much more than that . 
there is the question of the unemployment that may be created by rationalization , but that is not within the mandate of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans . 
that belongs to someone else in the government . 
perhaps it belongs to the Department of Human Resources . 
perhaps it is a matter of concern in regional economic development . 
i believe that the breaking up of the fishing way of life into an industry on the one hand and then into regional economic development or human resources on the other does not serve well the people involved in the fisheries nor of Canadians generally . 
the government should look at this division of responsibility and see if the problem could not be dealt with better by putting all aspects of the fisheries on the same table at the same time . 
finally , honourable senators , I am glad to see that the report suggests that the Estimates of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans go to the appropriate committeeof the Senate , the Standing Committee on Fisheries . 
i do not know what now happens in the other place with regard to the Estimates . 
historically , in the House of Commons , the review of departmental estimates was a great opportunity for members of that House and for the minister and his supporters to open up , to make transparent what was going on within the department . 
perhaps that still goes on , but I think there is a role to be performed by our own fisheries committee , that is , to set up a meaningful dialogue so that we are sure that the minister of the day understands the suspicions and uneasiness that underlie the attitudes of people in the fishing communities . 
that would be a great help . 
i am happy that the committee made that recommendation . 
before I sit down , I must say that I enjoyed my work on the committee . 
i thought that Senator Comeau did a splendid job as our chair . 
several other members also contributed greatly to the work of the committee . 
i was hoping that Senator Butts would be here so I could embarrass her by complimenting her on her dedication and contribution . 
she is , however , away at another committee so I must forego that pleasure . 
on motion of Senator Carstairs , for Senator Perrault , debate adjourned . 
Asia - Pacific Region 
report of Foreign Affairs Committee on Study - Inquiry - Debate Continued 
on the Order : 
honourable Senator Andreychuk ) . 
hon. Jerahmiel S . Grafstein : 
honourable senators , this matter stands in the name of Senator Andreychuk . 
i understand that she does not intend to speak to it until after the adjournment . 
i request consent to proceed today . 
i would then adjourn this inquiry in her name . 
hon. John B . Stewart : 
honourable senators , there may be another senator who wishes to speak before the Christmas adjournment . 
if we adjourn it in Senator Andreychuk ' s name with the view that she plans to speak in February , we may be blocking other senators . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , under our rules , even though an honourable senator has adjourned a debate in his or her name , any other honourable senator may speak . 
therefore , the Honourable Senator Grafstein is free to speak . 
senator Grafstein : 
honourable senators , traditionally , foreign policy ' s mission was to project our national interests abroad . 
traditionally , the preoccupation of foreign policy was to advance our security and economic interests beyond our borders . 
in democracies , " human rights " has become a hot button , an easy launch pad for any observer to critique foreign policy . 
foreign policy is a rippling reflection of domestic values and domestic preoccupations . 
are we faced with so complex an intellectual challenge that to articulate and develop a coherent and consistent foreign policy that encapsulates human rights remains beyond our reach ? 
given the limits of Canada ' s reach , what can be achieved ? 
to what extent do Canadians have , or should have , the capacity to interfere with the sovereignty of other states ? 
other than to tranquillize periodic domestic eruptions or cries of conscience , what else can we do ? 
to what extent can we , or should we , bring about change ? 
why make other than a synthetic effort ? 
is there a danger ? 
where do we start ? 
the strands of Canada ' s independent foreign policy for the modern era began to coagulate and solidify following the first Great War . 
which students attended Canada ' s school of " morality " in foreign policy ? 
indeed , did one ever exist ? 
this set off a major chord of revulsion in Canadians toward engagement , especially in Europe . 
between the world wars , the Canadian government ' s first priority was a struggle to attain an autonomous foreign policy that was separate from the centralizing influences and hegemony of the British Empire run out of the British Foreign Office . 
for Mr. King , and others , Wilsonian " morality " in foreign policy always took a back seat to questions of Canadian unity , particularly because the extreme western isolationist tendencies were accentuated by powerful isolationist Quebec voices . 
we noted a strange coupling between isolationist extremists in the West and Quebec for the same cause but for different reasons . 
to be fair , the Province of Quebec ' s different motive for turning inward was entwined with survival . 
senator Joyal reminded me that between 1890 and 1920 , over 1 million francophones had left Quebec for New England and the West . 
this massive loss in population - almost one - fifth of the total - had to be staunched to preserve continuity in Quebec . 
the Government of Quebec , influenced by the Church ' s reaction and preoccupation was to turn inward , to direct migration to the North and West of the province while ostracizing immigration from outside the province , from outside Canada . 
protecting the " pure laine " became an obsession of the governments of the Province of Quebec . 
Eayers differentiated between the values of the new and the old world . 
let me quote : 
in 1918 , Canadians turned away from Europe , leaving behind their dead . 
however misguided isolationism might appear to a later generation , drawn as their fathers had been into the vortex of militarism , it was a natural response to the brutal years at the Western Front . 
he went on to state : 
the world was still wide . 
the protection of the ocean - Atlantic and Pacific - might be added to that of the Munroe Doctrine . 
what more was required ? 
who indeed was the enemy . 
in 1920 , the Leader of the Opposition declared on military estimates , " There is no world menace . " 
as late as 1938 , 18 years later , Prime Minister Mackenzie King , still resonating with this conviction , declared " At present , the danger of attack upon Canada is minor in degree and second hand in origin . " 
to a large measure Canada could still lock the bolts of our own doors secured by the safety of our geography . 
when we review the events from the First World War to the onslaught of the Second World War we find successive governments ' constantly reducing and squeezing their military and naval budgets . 
we find a Quebec leader in Ottawa , Mr. Lapointe , declaring that Canadians have no interest " in losing a single life in Europe . " 
" Canadians care more about Alberta than Abyssinia , " he declared . 
canada initially supported , in a burst of Wilsonian enthusiasm , the Briand / Kellogg Pact and the League of Nations , even an ill - fated expeditionary force to revolutionary Russia . 
at the same time , Canada worked to separate itself from the British umbrella by disengagement and by exemptions from the Locarno Treaty in 1923 . 
during the Abyssinian crisis in 1935 , Canada had a change of heart . 
there was a clash between its representatives , especially Mr. Riddell in Geneva and Mr. King ' s government at home , who played a minor , yet significant , role in neutering the cohesion of the League of Nations covenants on security . 
meanwhile , the constant was the Canadian government ' s preoccupation to disengage from the directives and control of the British Foreign Office . 
" ready Eye Ready , " declared by Mr. Meighen was replaced by King ' s implicitly more evasive stance , " Not right now , perhaps never " when it came to involvement in international agreements , or the League of Nations sanctions against Italy or rearmament . 
indeed , Mr. King harboured a certain grudging admiration for the economic and corporate state policies of both Hitler and Mussolini . 
added to the strain of budgetary concerns that intensified during the Depression , consensus for withdrawal and disengagement from Europe that poured from the right and the centre of Canadian political life also flowed from that other " noble " impulse emanating from the CCF pacifists called unilateral disarmament . 
senators who are interested in history may equally recall that from a careful reading of the biographies and autobiographies of the leadership of the CCF , later the NDP , leaders of the unilateral disarmament pacifist movement in Canada , including Mr. Woodsworth , the sole member of Parliament , refused unanimous consent to Canada ' s Declaration of War in 1939 never recanted . 
even after World War II , those same leaders never recanted , with the noted exception of Frank Underhill who in the introduction to his book , In Search of Liberalism , noted his change in ideas . 
only he , to my limited examination , recanted about the error and the cost of those misguided pacifist policy impulses . 
rather , these political leaders on the left glided and glossed over their revised views , unrepentant and unbound . 
there was always one other muted contrapuntal chord in Canada ' s foreign policy that could be heard across the land . 
here , we uncover the roots of the NGOs and their developmental impulse which echoed and replicated the earlier social gospel of Canada ' s missionary movements , particularly to China . 
from before the turn of this century , Protestant and Catholic missionary streams flowed to China , towards western China , mostly from ` Toronto the Good . ' 
they preached that food and clothing for the body and schooling for the mind would " civilize " and deliver these untutored souls to the Church . 
these missionaries were singular , selfless and courageous . 
they established schools , organized " barefoot " doctors , and even a university in western China . 
many missionary offspring or offspring of clergy formed the basis of Canada ' s first foreign service . 
hence the social gospel permeated the thinking of those young diplomats in the making from the very beginning of our foreign service . 
it is equally fair to note that during those intervening war years that only 11 Chinese immigrants were allowed entry into Canada . 
we practised a racist , closed door domestic policy that continued well beyond the cusp of World War II. 
yet , one noble , if futile , effort propelled by the far left to fight fascism in Spain was a modest counterweight to the Canadian consensus of disengagement . 
canada was coated with a heavy brush of racism that blended well with its isolationist tendencies . 
honourable senators , the question of morality and Canadian politics was filtered through the prisms of unilateral disarmament on the left , the closed door immigration policies on the right , and a general consensus of disenchantment and disengagement from the antique disputes within Europe . 
the missionary theme itself was different , yet only differed in background music to the louder strains of isolationism on the main Canadian stage . 
such was the case until September 1939 . 
multilateral engagement replaced isolationism and disengagement on security issues and political issues as a mainspring of Canadian foreign policy . 
with Churchill warning of an Iron Curtain in 1947 , Canada joined the U.S. in confronting and containing the rising expansionist policies in Europe and beyond , although diffidently and without the coarseness of the McCarthy era . 
we tended to examine the other side more generously in the Cold War , even as we shared limited containment . 
we flirted with coexistence more than our U.S. ally . 
with rare exception , Canada almost never took leadership on " human rights " or " democratic rights " on the bilateral front . 
canada came to support the dissident movements reluctantly and hesitantly . 
proactive individuals and private groups took leadership roles . 
between the war years , Canada never embraced the Wilsonian organizing principles of the international " rule of law " and " self - determination " policies , or " freeing minorities " or " open treaties " of the Wilson and post - Wilson period . 
it was only in the 1960 s , awakened by the clarion call of Kennedy , that Canada began to imitate the American preoccupation in an asymmetrical way , and timidly lift the torch of " human rights " - " freedom " - but only selected freedom , for those that could not trade or bite back too boldly . 
the notable exception was John Diefenbaker . 
he was the first prime minister to loudly trumpet the rights and freedoms of those countries in Eastern Europe locked behind the Iron Curtain . 
it was Diefenbaker who led on easing South Africa out of the Commonwealth , despite criticism from the centre and the left . 
it was John Diefenbaker who alone raised the issue of a statutory Charter of Rights and laid the groundwork for the Charter of Rights later to be incorporated into the Constitution by Pierre Trudeau . 
the 1982 Charter gave new legitimacy to this activist human rights impulse across Canada . 
it was a turning point in Canada ' s history . 
it was the turning point in Canadian policy . 
honourable senators , one of the most puzzling choices in foreign policy remains the nature of our relations with countries , large and small , that sustain an undemocratic structure and fall below standards of conduct respecting human rights . Shall 
we trade or tango ? 
canada is a middle power whose liveliness depends on economic growth in an undulating global economy . 
canada ' s greater dependence on trade makes our domestic economy more vulnerable . 
one school of thought believes that , armed with sanctions and containment , aberrant national will will melt and meld in human rights norms . 
that was the South African experience . 
yet , we should recall that , during our sanction policies , trade with South Africa significantly increased . 
while the " sanctions " school is still encountering difficulty in this multi - polar world , constructive engagement is another alternative . 
canada has chosen the latter course . Hence , 
we led in recognizing China before the United States . 
we maintained relations with Cuba . 
constructive engagement , we believe , allows states that are falling below our standards respecting human rights to build ladders if they choose . 
engagement was better than isolation . 
is there a way of evolving into a world order that has , as its base , constructive engagement and trade while satisfying our need for greater movement toward our targets of deeper democracy and respect for human rights under the rule of law ? 
with that rather lengthy introduction , let me turn to the object of our current inquiry , the report of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee on Asia . 
this report carefully surveys the current turbulence in Asia . 
the report describes important failures within the collective foreign policies of the West on both the economic and human rights fronts . 
every state and international institution failed to recognize , or at least failed to prevent , what , in retrospect , was failure or at least inaction on almost every foreign policy front . 
read the report . 
why is this so ? 
herein lies the dual essence of this report . 
can Canada learn from these mistakes and prevent recurrences in the future ? 
turning to the facet of " human rights " in Asia , one should turn to Appendix 5 to find an exhaustive compendium of human rights violations , country by country . 
we are indebted to Senate testimony , the U.S. State Department Annual Human Rights Reports , and Human Rights Watch World as the sources of its information . 
our final recommendation , number 17 , proposes that an activist agenda of human rights principles be incorporated into the day - to - day exercise of Canada ' s foreign policy . 
in a recent statement by our Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lloyd Axworthy , in Edmonton on November 27 , he outlined Canada ' s ever - expanding list of preoccupations on the human rights front . 
he described the recent change in his department ' s priorities . 
he noted , for example , recent meetings of a Bilateral Committee on Human Rights with China . 
he said , and I quote : 
we have reached out at a bilateral level too , retooling our approach with a number of countries to develop civil society initiatives , construct democratic institutions and engage in serious human rights dialogue . 
this is the objective behind the establishment of bilateral human rights mechanisms with countries such as China , Cuba and Indonesia . 
he goes on to say : 
such agreements have led to substantive engagement on human rights issues and the opportunity to invest in building up human rights groups and institutions in these countries . 
for instance , with China , we have created a Joint Committee on Human Rights . 
it recently met in Winnipeg and Whitehorse to exchange views on a range of human rights issues . 
we held a pluralateral symposium on human rights , which included independent human rights institutions from the region . 
we are currently working on projects relating to legal reform and economic , social and cultural rights . 
minister Axworthy goes on to give a complete list of his activities on human rights fronts . 
it seems that Canada is finally moving along on the human rights front . 
this Senate report , as a compendium of abuses , serves as only a cursory comment on human rights problems as perceived by your committee . 
it is a necessary primer , but only a primer . 
we concluded , after our survey , that a different approach , a human rights vector , should be injected formally into our foreign policy formulation . 
this is only a tentative step . 
we did not describe or explore implementation . 
why this enhanced sensitivity now ? 
i have detected in the Senate chamber a growing intensity of interest in the Senate in the last decade on the human rights agenda . 
why ? 
perhaps the shift in our demographic template has put pressure on our traditional policy . 
canada ' s demographic has shifted dramatically in the last two decades . 
TV and demography have changed the rules of the game in Canada . 
cohorts of recent immigrants and refugees have joined our civic discourse . 
in Toronto , there is a strong majority , and a strong plurality in other cities across Canada , that now represent visible minorities . 
individuals from these groups share a much higher sensitivity and a much closer knowledge of abuses in each region of the globe . 
this report thus represents the Senate ' s first serious look at human rights in recent times . 
hon. Shirley Maheu ( The Hon. The Acting Speaker ) : 
i regret to interrupt the honourable senator , but his time has expired . 
is leave granted , honourable senators , to allow Senator Grafstein to continue ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
senator Grafstein : 
thank you , honourable senators . 
as a benchmark , the report dispels a commonly held myth that human rights is only a western preoccupation , that human rights in Asia differ because of Asia ' s different cultures . 
let me point out three examples that dispel the myth - Japan , Singapore and China . 
Japan , a hermetic society , has become , in less than half a century , a relentless democracy . 
Singapore , criticized as an oligarchic democracy , but a democracy nonetheless , has stringent codes of civil rights . 
china , groping tentatively , even fearfully , toward democratic practices , can be observed at the grassroots , in the villages across China , experiencing an activist democratic thrust in local decision making . 
we did not have the time to more than scratch the surface on the Chinese experience . 
china now contains 56 national minorities , including over 90 million people inhabiting more than 50 per cent of Chinese territories . 
i recall , during a visit to the Xinjian Autonomous Regionover a decade ago , I chided our Uighur hosts for not speaking their own first language , even though that was first of the two official languages in that autonomous region . 
yesterday , in The New York Times , there was a report which begins with the headline " China Appears Ready for Trial of a Leader of Outlawed Party , " and states in part : 
Mr. Wang announced the formation of the Democracy Party when President Clinton visited in the spring . 
he and other dissidents hoped that China ' s new friendship with the United States and its decision to sign a global covenant on political and civil rights would give them room to promote political alternatives . 
Mr. Wang was a student leader in the pro - democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989 , was arrested and served two years in prison . 
yes , he is on trial again . 
he is on trial for having established a political party . 
what are we to do ? 
are we to refer this matter to the recently established bilateral joint committee on human rights established by Minister Axworthy ? 
your committee , regretfully , did not have the time to probe deeply into these models , nor to derive , if we could , appropriate lessons . 
such lessons could be instructive . 
in the Senate we recognize Canada ' s limited resources and high expectations on the " human rights " frontier . 
a deeper study of human rights would allow us to make more informed choices . Where 
should Canada ' s efforts be deployed on the human rights front , and in a cost - effective way ? 
regretfully , we did not have the time to make this assay . 
what , honourable senators , can we conclude ? 
what questions must be answered ? 
as activists on the multilateral front , is there hidden leverage we have yet to uncover ? 
are there better ways to deploy and leverage the assets of international organizations with egregious states wishing to join or collaborate with international organizations ; APEC , World Bank , IMF , WTO , to name a few ? 
are we able to move , via the international " rule of law , " to better marginalize governments and leaders who habitually abuse " human rights " ? 
recall , honourable senators , this partial catalogue of human rights conventions and declarations : the UN Charter in 1945 ; the Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 ; the Human Convention on the Prevention of Genocide in 1951 ; the UN Accord on the Protection of Minorities in 1967 ; the UN Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in 1969 ; the Helsinki Accord in 1975 ; UN Declaration on Religious Discrimination in 1981 ; and , the Convention Against Torture in 1984 . 
the list goes on . 
the majority of States , who perpetrate the greatest breaches of " human rights , " are happy members of international organizations and have paid lip service to and , indeed , ratified many of these conventions . 
there is little or no mechanism , however , to provide enforcement . 
this question of enforcement has neither been systematically nor systemically addressed or monitored . 
canada , now a leader in the establishment of the Court of International Justice and a member of the Security Council , could begin a systematic review with member states of the UN to test the theory . 
if you wish to belong to a club you should comply with the rules . 
what more could be considered by Canada in this mostly unploughed field ? 
i submit the following steps : 
an annual Canada report on human rights conventions and the status of each state ' s ratification ; the study of the role and effectiveness of sanctions ; the organizational role of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade , the foreign service and the PMO in implementing " Human Rights " foreign policy ; the work of Transparency International as it reflects not just business practices but also ethical sourcing for imports ; the compliance powers of the international organizations themselves to enforce their own conventions and treaties with respect to " human rights " ; the role of the media , television , radio and the power of the worldwide net to bring human rights issues and concerns to a wider and more immediate public audience . 
these are just a few of the avenues that the government could explore . 
the enforcement of international law is an essential area of exploration . 
the Latin expression is , Ubi jus , ibi remedium ; where there is a law there is a remedy . 
regretfully , honourable senators , mechanisms for breaches of international law have never exactly been a democratic preoccupation . 
historically , concrete initiatives for human rights came not from governments but from parliamentarians or from the grassroots . 
the Helsinki Accord was not started by governments , it came from the grassroots . 
for example , in 1975 the United States Congress insisted , not the government , that the Department of State compile an annual report of " human rights " violations . 
i have heard from Senator Prud ' homme about the deficiencies in that report , nevertheless , it is an excellent report . 
this was followed by the Jackson / Vanek Amendment on Russian Immigration in return for most - favoured nation status . 
criticized at the time , these small steps energized human rights debates and made a difference . 
" linkage " is abhorred by the diplomats . 
diplomats prefer multilateralism , which does have its place but so does bilateralsim . 
honourable senators , let me conclude with these two thoughts : 
the 20 th century set a record , a record for creating more states , more democracy and more state inspired bloodshed . 
what a sorry legacy we will have left behind this century . 
the work of " human rights " gives us small hope , a slender hope , that there might be a better way . 
the Senate report takes us another incremental step along this winding path to democratic development . 
in conclusion , we might recall the words of Reinhold Niebuhr : 
man ' s capacity for justice makes democracy possible , but man ' s inclination to injustice , makes democracy necessary . 
some Hon. Senators : 
hear hear ! 
hon. Peter A . Stollery : 
honourable senators , I rise to speak on the tabling last week of the report of the Foreign Affairs Committee , entitled " Crisis in Asia , Implications for the Region , Canada and the World , " which deals with some of the problems facing countries of the Far East . 
i would start by thanking our research staff . 
without Mr. Peter Berg and Ms Colleen Hoey , our committee could not have completed this report . 
we began this inquiry nearly two years ago when the Asian miracle was all the fashion . 
our time frame allowed us to reflect on the collapse of the miracle and the confusion of so many experts . 
in this environment , our research team was of special importance . 
... most economists and crystal ball gazers believe that over the course of the next decade or two , at least half of world economic growth will be in that region . 
Dr. Charles A . Barrett , Ph . D . , Vice - President , Business Research , the Conference Board of Canada talked about " ... the dynamic emerging economies of the Asia - Pacific region . " 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable Senator Stollery , I am sorry to have to interrupt you but it is six o ' clock . 
unless I have an agreement from the Senate not to see the clock , I must leave the Chair . 
hon. Marcel Prud ' homme : 
honourable senators , there are many major events tonight - one that is very important to the people who hold the majority here . 
could we have an idea of the length of the speech of the Honourable Senator Stollery ? 
he has a great knowledge of these matters and he will provoke more discussion . 
i should like to know how lengthy the debate will be because I am interested in this issue also . 
however , I will not speak today so that those honourable senators who are in the majority in this chamber may attend their event . 
it is their evening and I do not want to hurt them . 
however , I should like to hear all the honourable senator ' s speech in one shot and not half today and half at some other time . 
senator Stollery : 
honourable senators , I recognize the problem . 
i will speed it up . 
i will not stand here and be dramatic . 
i shall go right through it , and you can read the drama in Hansard tomorrow . 
hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , we have agreement not to see the clock . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
there is agreement not to see the clock ? 
senator Prud ' homme : 
Yes. 
senator Stollery : 
honourable senators , Dr. Barrett talked about " ... the dynamic emerging economies of the Asia - Pacific region , " and that the Conference Board had undertaken , " an extensive body of research on various aspects of Canada ' s economic relations with the Asia - Pacific . " 
Dr. Barrett spoke to us on November 27 , 1996 . 
the latest economic figures that he would have had show that Japan ' s GDP growth that averaged 4 per cent between 1981 and 1990 had dropped to 1.4 per cent between 1991 - 95 . 
the Japanese stock market had dropped from a high of 29,437 in 1990 to 17,329 in 1995 . 
i do not doubt that the conference board does research on Far East economies , but how could they have missed the most basic statistics showing serious decline in the country that , according to Joseph Stiglitz , Chief Economist of the World Bank , accounts for 90 per cent of the region ' s gross domestic product ? 
there is a reason why facts are ignored . 
it is very serious , and I will get to it in a minute . 
first , I should like to talk about the financial and economic failures that are so clearly described in chapter 2 of our report . 
i think that any reasonable person might ask why , only four years after the $ 60 billion emergency assistance by the United States to Mexico to avoid massive default , $ 117.7 billion U.S. had to be assembled to support Indonesia , Thailand and South Korea . 
the prospect of that so frightened the U.S. Federal Reserve that they forced shareholders in other private companies to bail out Long Term Capital Management . 
i might add that the management of Long Term Capital Management had put their personal assets in their wives ' names only two weeks before the fund was about to collapse . 
however , they were not penalized and actually kept their interest in the hedge fund , unlike the chairman of the Union des Banques Suisses , who at least had the decency to resign , along with the head of Barkley ' s Bank , who also resigned . 
make no mistake . 
these sorry tales are all connected . 
what is going on ? 
how could anyone defend the current global financial system that leads to these results ? 
i am not a financial wheeler - dealer , but I have friends who are . 
when we talk about " massive capital flows " in our report , I understand something about shares and bonds but I have to consult when it gets to " short - term instruments . " 
remember that the kind of money that crashes countries ' financial systems must be liquid in a few seconds by computer . 
you cannot easily liquidate a factory or a legitimate business . 
all I know about the complexities of hedge funds , short - selling debt and leveraging bets is that they are all being done without international controls . 
it can be done in a flash . 
these capital flows can be enormous - far beyond the capacity of any central bank to prop up their currencies , including the Canadian central bank . 
honourable senators , in June , I attended the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly in Strasbourg . 
it was a very useful visit . 
the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee has followed international trade policy for many years . 
this was the first time I had the opportunity to hear Monsieur Camdessus , Managing Director of the IMF , and I was very impressed . 
members of our committee know that I have been critical of " globalization " for a long time . 
i think it is fair to call myself the committee sceptic . 
naturally , Monsieur Camdessus defends global markets because his employers , mostly the Americans , insist that he does . 
he said : 
do you not feel it ought to make it possible to engage in a process of reflection and discussions on potential improvements to the present floating - rate system , the limitations of which were clearly shown by the Asian crisis , and the resulting huge currency fluctuations ? 
it is probably unrealistic to think of creating a new international system based on fixed exchange rates . 
might it not be worthwhile , however , to create " target zones " ? 
for 20 years in my lengthy career as an international civil servant , I have been a voice crying in the wilderness for stabilization of the exchange rate , and the creation of " target zones " or " plausibility zones " to be taken seriously by the major powers . 
some progress has been made on this , particularly in the Louvre Accord and the Plaza Agreement . 
yet we are still far from having a satisfactory system . 
honourable senators , international trade is disrupted by erratic movements in exchange rates . 
think of the impact on Canadian jobs . 
Mr. Thiessen , Governor of the Bank of Canada , puts much of the blame for Canada ' s weak dollar on weak commodity prices . 
he told the standing Senate Committee on Banking , Trade and Commerce on November 19 : 
the worldwide capital flight to the safe haven of U.S. assets and the 15 per cent decline over the past year in the prices of primary commodities that we export have been the main factors behind the marked depreciation of our currency against the U.S. dollar . 
he did not respond to Senator Tkachuk ' s observation that the Canadian dollar has been declining for years against the U.S. dollar , and he overlooked the fact that the Canadian dollar has declined steeply against the French franc and the Deutschmark and the yen over just the past three or four months . 
i have followed the French franc for 40 years , and I have never seen it so high against the Canadian dollar . 
an observer might say - and I will impose too much on your patience - that I have travelled far from the Far East to the Council of Europe to the Canadian dollar . 
yes , I have . 
i believe there will be no recovery in world trade unless three things happen . 
first , there must be recovery in Japan . 
Japan ' s economy accounts for about 18 per cent of world GDP . 
in April , Moody ' s , the credit rating service , placed Japanese sovereign debt under scrutiny as a result of the concern over the long - term outlook for the economy . 
that was in April . 
the Wall Street Journal reported last week that Japan ' s GDP contracted in four consecutive quarters for the first time in history . 
honourable senators know that these statistics are bad - this , in a country with 90 per cent of the GDP of the Far East region . 
how can the rest of the region recover until Japan recovers ? 
let me read you an excerpt from a speech I made in Strasbourg : 
... we speak about the structural factors in the Japanese economy . 
anyone who has been to Japan has noticed the tremendous contradiction between the absolute efficiency of export - oriented industry and the massive inefficiency in Japanese society as a whole . 
when I visited Japan , I travelled about 600 kilometres on a bicycle because I was curious about Japanese society and wanted to know what was going on . 
there cannot be structural changes without the support of the people . 
i got lost cycling one day , went down a road and found myself on a massive construction site with 43 huge cranes , where a factory was being built . 
further down the road , I saw hundreds if not thousands of people transplanting rice from small boxes - the sort that all of us use when we work in our gardens - into rice paddies not much bigger than my garden . 
they were squatting in the water , doing the sorts of things that we saw in the Far East 40 years ago , except that these people were earning $ 35,000 U.S. a year to do that . 
that cannot work and it is not a simple thing to change . 
... we can talk for a long time about how Japan must restructure . 
i said that in June , and that is what I think today . 
second , there must be a serious attempt to restructure the world monetary system because the present situation of massive , unrecorded and unimpeded capital flows cannot be allowed to continue . 
i strongly believe that the resistance of central bankers , beginning with Mr. Greenspan in Washington , is partly because their friends , the private bankers , make lots of money on the multitude of transactions and damn the consequences . 
central bankers , in my opinion , are in a conflict of interest situation which , in any other business , would not be tolerated . 
in a famous passage from The General Theory of Employment Interests and Money , John Maynard Keynes wrote , and I quote : 
the ideas of economists and political philosophers , both when they are right and when they are wrong , are more powerful than is commonly understood . 
indeed , the world is ruled by little else . 
the reason that Dr. Saywell and Dr. Barrett and many others made statements that they would probably not like to be reminded of is the current atmosphere of unbalanced but fashionable ideas . 
i do not recall any period in my lifetime when correctness , in so many ways , has been so important , even to hold a job . 
it is a dangerous atmosphere in which to experiment with people ' s money . 
Pishtaco - the word is " Quechua . " 
the Pishtaco is a feared and hated pale - skinned demon with an insatiable appetite for fat . 
they boil people in huge cooking pots or scrape them as empty as water skins . 
it can be dangerous , to this day , for pale - skinned whites to venture into certain regions of the Amazonian forest because there is no way to distinguish them from Pishtacos . 
the global financial market is our Pishtaco . 
it sucks money , but no one knows where . 
on motion of Senator Kinsella , for Senator Andreychuk , debate adjourned . 
business of the Senate 
hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I understand there is a willingness to let all other items on the Order Paper stand , with the exception of Motion No. 105 , which I ask to be called now . 
recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone 
agriculture and Forestry Committee Authorized to Extend Date of Final Report 
hon. Leonard J . Gustafson , pursuant to notice of December 3 , 1998 , moved : 
that with respect to the Order of the Senate adopted on May 14 , 1998 , to examine the Recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone ( rBST ) and its effect on the human and animal health safety , the Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry be permitted , notwithstanding usual practices , to deposit its report with the Clerk of the Senate , if the Senate is not then sitting ; and that the report be deemed to have been tabled in the Chamber . 
honourable senators , the approval of rBST has been a subject of much controversy in Canada and other countries for a number of years now . 
this non - therapeutic veterinary hormone has increased milk production by 10 per cent to 15 per cent when administered to cows . 
if I may , I wish to outline the committee ' s experience to date . 
much of the controversy surrounding the hormone is related to the potential long - term effect on animals and on humans who have consumed milk from rBST - treated animals . 
the Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry has held a number of hearings , beginning in June 1998 and continuing through to a full day on Tuesday . 
the committee has also received hundreds of letters and e - mails from concerned Canadians . 
while the process to be followed for the approval of therapeutic and non - therapeutic drugs for human and animal use is outlined in the Food and Drug Act and its regulations , many witnesses have suggested to the committee that the proper procedures are not being followed with respect to the approval of rBST . 
it has also been suggested that proper procedures may not have been followed in other areas that affect human health , with particular mention of tainted blood and breast implants . 
canada has a worldwide reputation for the high quality of its food products . 
that reputation must not suffer . 
this is not to conclude that rBST is necessarily unsafe , but rather to indicate that all Canadians , indeed all consumers worldwide , must be assured of the safety of a product before it is used . 
public confidence in our food production as well as in the drug approval process must be assured . 
the committee has heard testimony about some of the economic benefits of rBST use in terms of enhanced profitability and competitiveness , particularly for small operations and the environment . 
however , the committee has also heard presentations indicating that milk production can be increased without the use of rBST and that , given this fact , rBST should not be approved . 
certain problems that might be characterized as management problems within the Health Protection Branch of Health Canada have been brought to the committee ' s attention . 
there have been allegations of coercion , gagging , pressure , and even stolen files . 
it would appear that the department perhaps lacks the proper mechanism to resolve differences among its scientists . 
the committee was told by senior departmental officials that these allegations are seen as extremely serious , and mention was made of the Health Protection Branch ' s transition initiative which may help to resolve some of the concerns in the branch . 
where does all this leave the committee ? 
because of its concurrent study of the farm income crisis , time constraints force the committee to request permission to table the report with the Clerk of the Senate in January of 1999 . That report will summarize the testimony received by the committee on these very important issues and will contain recommendations in key areas . 
as with the hearings that have been undertaken to date , the committee believes that this report will make a useful contribution to the debate about rBST use in Canada and will also inform the public . 
i ask honourable senators to support this motion and I thank you for your patience . 
hon. Senators : 
hear , hear ! 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
if no other senator wishes to speak , is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
motion agreed to . 
veterans Health Care Services 
social Affairs , Science and Technology Committee Authorized to Extend Date of Final Report 
hon. Orville Phillips , pursuant to notice of December 8 , 1998 , moved : 
that , notwithstanding the Order of the Senate adopted on November 5 , 1997 , the Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs , Science and Technology which was authorized to examine and report on the state of health care in Canada concerning veterans of war and Canadian Service persons , be empowered to submit its final report no later than February 26 , 1999 ; and 
that the Committee be permitted , notwithstanding usual practices , to deposit its report with the Clerk of the Senate , if the Senate is not then sitting ; and that the report be deemed to have been tabled in the Chamber . 
motion agreed to . 
estimates of Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
fisheries Committee Authorized to Table Report with Clerk of the Senate 
hon. No ë l A . Kinsella ( Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) for Senator Comeau , pursuant to notice of December 8 , 1998 , moved : 
that the Standing Senate Committee on Fisheries , having been authorized by the Senate on December 1 , 1998 to examine and report upon the Estimates of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans for the fiscal year ending March 31 , 1998 ( Parts I and II , tabled in the Senate on March 17 , 1998 ; Report on Priorities and Planning and Departmental Performance Report , tabled in the Senate on November 3 , 1998 ) , and other matters relating to the fishing industry , be empowered to present its final report no later than December 10 , 1999 ; and 
that the Committee be permitted , notwithstanding usual practices , to deposit its report with the Clerk of the Senate , if the Senate is not then sitting ; and that the report be deemed to have been tabled in the Chamber . 
motion agreed to . 
the Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

the Senate met at 2:00 p.m. , the Speaker in the Chair . 
prayers . 
visitors in the Gallery 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , I should like to draw your attention to eight distinguished diplomats who are present in our gallery . 
they are the deans of the regions of the diplomatic corps in Ottawa , accompanied by the Chief of Protocol for the Department of Foreign Affairs , Mr. Alain Dudoit . 
honourable deans , we welcome you to the Senate of Canada . 
tributes 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , it is not normally the tradition in the Senate to comment on events in the other place . 
however , yesterday there occurred a tragedy on the floor of the other place - a most profound loss that has touched every one of us as members of Canada ' s Parliament . 
she was the tough and tenacious Crown prosecutor . 
she was a woman of a generous and courageous heart . 
she brought us all the strength of her stormy passion for justice , as well as the depth of her friendship and the sunshine of her laughter . 
yes , the member for Windsor - St. 
Clair was , indeed , magic . 
Shaughnessy personified all that was good and noble about political life . 
she was a dynamic reformer with a dramatic inability to accept the status quo . 
she spent all of her tireless energies in the pursuit of a better country and a better world . 
today , we mourn a woman who died too young - a woman who was many things to many people . 
she was a tireless crusader , a passionate Canadian , and a loyal and delightful friend to all who had the privilege of her company . 
i will think of Shaughnessy always as a strong and abiding light - a light which shone on all who had the privilege of knowing her and a light which we who serve in political life will always remember . 
that memory will make us strong and it will make us resolute , because the memory of Shaughnessy Cohen will forever be magic . 
we join hands and hearts , as a parliamentary family , in extending to her husband and daughter an expression of great sorrow and heartfelt sympathy . 
hon. No ë l A . Kinsella ( Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
a few days ago , some of us were joined by Shaughnessy as we lunched with Mary Robinson , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights . 
Shaughnessy Cohen embraced human rights and she embraced public affairs and politics - all to the good of Parliament and all to the good of the people of Canada . 
may she now be embraced in peace in the bosom of Abraham . 
hon. Marcel Prud ' homme : 
honourable senators , I wish to add my tribute to those of senators Graham and Kinsella . 
i came to know Ms Cohen through my heavy involvement in the parliamentary associations . 
let me tell you , when Mrs. Cohen , along with her very good friend Mrs. Finestone , took part in the activities of the Parliamentary Union , people listened . 
i have had the pleasure of travelling with her on several occasions always in connection with International Parliamentary Union meetings . 
everything about this tragedy has been printed in the press , which I read this morning . 
i went to see the Honourable Sheila Finestone this morning because I know how close she was to Shaughnessy , and to other colleagues here . 
she was a tough and intelligent parliamentarian . 
she was also an independent - minded person - the type of person who should be multiplied many times in both Houses . 
i want to pay homage to her and join with Senator Graham and others in offering her family our deepest sympathy . 
hon. Eugene Whelan : 
honourable senators , I rise today to pay my respects to Shaughnessy Cohen . 
i am greatly saddened by the loss of our sister , our colleague and our very dear friend , Shaughnessy . 
she had a passion and a sincere dedication not only to the job that she did but also to the people who she represented . 
this , coupled with her incredible energy and vitality , earned respect from all who knew her . 
as has been said by the previous speakers in much better words than I can put together , there is no doubt in my mind that the impact that she has had not only in the riding of Windsor - St. 
Clair but throughout Canada was tremendous . 
she was a really true Canadian . 
Shaughnessy was a valued and hard - working young woman . 
she forged her mark in the House of Commons in the different duties that she carried on , such as chair of the House Justice Committee . 
i fondly remember when she was president of my riding association of Essex - Windsor . 
our daughter , Susan , who is now the member for Essex , the adjoining constituency of Shaughnessy ' s , has fond childhood memories of Shaughnessy . 
Susan remembers Shaughnessy taking part in my riding activities . 
Susan has lost not only a good friend but also an adopted sister . 
Shaughnessy ' s dynamic personality , her wonderful sense of humour , her life and her genuine care for people will surely be missed . 
i and my wife , Liz , offer our deepest sympathy to Jerry and her daughter , Dena . 
our thoughts and prayers are with them during this most difficult time . 
Shaughnessy was the oldest of five girls . 
her dad liked to hunt . 
Shaughnessy was what you might call his " oldest son " because her father made her go hunting with him . 
they lived in a small town called Thamesville , Ontario , between the cities of Chatham and London . 
Shaughnessy ' s father is still an active pharmacist there . 
about a week ago she told me , " I forgot to call my dad on his birthday , so I called him the next day . 
she had that great sense of humour , and she came from a wonderful family . 
after Shaughnessy was in university , her father and mother , who are still alive , adopted three native boys , who have all been very successful in life . 
this is the kind of family she came from - a community - minded , caring family . 
she not only knew Windsor , Toronto and Ottawa , but she knew rural Canada , and she loved it . 
as chair of the Justice Committee , she made sure that she just did not stay behind these stone walls in marble halls . 
we have heard it expressed so well about how she dealt with the committee and how she dealt with witnesses who came before the committee . 
this was the Shaughnessy Cohen we knew . 
after the Ontario caucus met yesterday , the southwestern Ontario caucus met . 
there were 10 or 11 of us there . 
Shaughnessy was making representation on behalf of the distillers for some regulations that needed to be changed by cabinet . 
as a former cabinet minister , I told her how we would do it just like that , and she said , " They better do it just like that while I am here , too . " 
she talked about a member of the Parliament who had lost her husband , and how we must do something to help . 
she contacted other caucus colleagues to make sure that this member of Parliament from the North , who has four children and had just bought a house , also needed help . 
as I said , she was a caring person . 
after that , she opened her purse and took out a bottle . 
it was not what you think ; it was a bottle of shoe polish . 
she polished her shoes , Karen Redman polished her shoes , Roger Gallaway polished his shoes , and then I polished mine . 
i do not know if anyone has noticed that my shoes were a little bit better looking than they are normally . 
that was the kind of person she was , and the kind of person with whom we had the pleasure to be associated . 
honourable senators , we have lost the member of Parliament for Windsor - St. 
Clair , but her husband , Jerry , has lost a wife and companion of over 25 years . 
i offer my sincere condolences to her family - her husband , Jerry , and her daughter , Dena , her mother and father , her sisters and brothers , and all of their families . 
as the Irish say , I am sure Shaughnessy is gone to the happy hunting ground , and I am sure the little people she always cared for will look after her . 
hon. Mabel M. DeWare : 
honourable senators , I rise with sorrow this afternoon to pay tribute to the Liberal member of Parliament , Shaughnessy Cohen . 
everyone was shocked and saddened by Shaughnessy ' s sudden and unexpected collapse and death yesterday . 
we are also profoundly shaken . 
this tragedy was a chilling reminder of our own mortality . 
more than that , though , it helped those of us in other parties to focus on the things that are really important . 
before she entered public life , Shaughnessy worked in law , a field for which she had a deep and abiding passion . 
after being called to the bar in 1979 , she put this enthusiasm to work for clients as a criminal defence lawyer in Windsor . 
thanks to her hard work , she later became a part - time assistant Crown attorney and a federal prosecutor for Essex County . 
for almost a decade , Shaughnessy was the only female lawyer in Windsor ' s criminal courts . 
it must have been difficult for her at times , yet she did not falter . 
perhaps this was a factor in her dedication to feminist causes , which was apparent to the very end . 
honourable senators , Shaughnessy first entered federal politics as a candidate in the 1988 election . 
she did not succeed but , as in many other things , she persevered . 
her efforts paid off in 1993 when she was swept to Ottawa . 
Mrs. Cohen was a proactive , popular MP willing to stand up for her constituents , who re - elected her handily in 1997 . 
in addition to her commitment to public service , she also had a warm , fun - loving side of her personality that endeared her to all her colleagues . 
her keen wit , her mischievous sense of humour and her no - nonsense irreverent attitude ensured things were never dull when she was around . 
her good - natured pranks and political jokes have become the stuff of legend on Parliament Hill ; but most of all , these actions remind us all not to take ourselves too seriously . 
i remember in particular a meeting this fall of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Custody and Access . 
Shaughnessy was an occasional member of that committee . 
it was the night of the Halloween party in the West Block . 
she came over to the committee and dumped her bag of candy on the table at the back of the room , sorted it all out like our kids do after Halloween night , and proceeded to give everyone some of it . 
as we all munched on candy , the mood in the room lightened , and the members became much more cooperative and willing to listen to each other . 
Mrs. Cohen also had a finely honed sense of professionalism , which she applied in her committee work . 
she distinguished herself as chairwoman of the Justice Committee in the other place , and was serving her second term in that position . 
she impressed everyone who was familiar with her work , even though they may not have agreed with her . 
honourable senators , Parliament has lost an impressive member who will be sorely missed . 
Shaughnessy ' s colleagues join me in expressing our sadness at the untimely death of this remarkable person and parliamentarian . 
we would also like to offer our sincere condolence to her husband , Jerry , and her stepdaughter , Dena . 
visitors in the Gallery 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , before I call for Senators ' Statements , I should like to draw your attention to the presence in the gallery of a group of young Canadians from the Hunt Club Girl Guides , the Lisgar Collegiate Institute , and la Polyvalente Grande - Rivi è re , who are participating in events to commemorate the 50 th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . 
these young people came to the Hill to participate in a program prepared for them , but because of the unfortunate death of Shaughnessy Cohen , the program could not be continued . 
i will host them in my chambers later today to commemorate human rights day . 
on behalf of all honourable senators , I welcome you here to the Senate on this very important universal day of human rights . 
senators ' STATEMENTS 
united Nations 
fiftieth Anniversary of Signing of Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , when the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was proclaimed in a resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations 50 years ago today , Canadians took great pride in the fact that John Peters Humphrey , a Professor of Law at McGill University , prepared the first draft of the declaration and guided it to its adoption . 
by his side was the great Nobel Laureate and resistance fighter , Ren é Cassin of France , and subsequent drafters such as the gifted Eleanor Roosevelt , Dr. Charles Malik of Lebanon , and Dr. P . C . Chang of China - all of them brilliant , staunch internationalists who knew that peace was a long journey , and that there are no shortcuts to freedom . 
they conceived the document whose principles we celebrate today - principles which were not really constructed in 1948 but were revealed in 1948 ; principles which all the world ' s great religions have held to be true . 
as Dr. Chang pointed out at the time , Confucius articulated these same universal rights in ancient China . 
thus , this ringing declaration , which states that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights , was born and became the moral conscience of mankind . 
they took that first step in Paris , knowing full well that the journey ahead of them was long and full of danger . 
they took that first step in that assembly of citizens of the world . 
in doing so , they turned a corner in the course of history into the first dawn of rights and freedoms , a world in which human beings would have freedom of speech , freedom of belief , freedom from want and freedom from fear . 
today , in 1998 , many of us look back to the idealism of those early defenders of human rights , all those who had such hope for humanity . 
we look back at them and see that the record is rather mixed . 
we look at international tribunals that have been frustrated in their attempts to prosecute the perpetrators of genocide and murder . 
we look at unconscionable social and economic inequities that , in our time , are growing . 
we look at all the violence of unrestrained ethnic and racial conflicts across the planet . 
however , on this day of celebration , we must look a little closer , and the look must be heartfelt . 
we must look at the evolution of a new , interventionist - minded , global community , and at the trends toward increasing democratization and the growing importance of global governance . 
that conscience is growing in small places close to home in our communities , in our neighbourhood schools , and in all the little places that , as Eleanor Roosevelt once said , are often too small to be on the maps of the world , but where every man , woman and child seeks equal justice , equal opportunity and equal dignity without discrimination . 
that conscience is growing as part of the complex web of international regimes and normative wisdom and human rights laws that are all part of the infrastructure of a new world emerging from the old . 
while many of us worry about the unruly frontier society , which is the dark side of the Internet , I believe it to be an unparalleled agent of human rights advocacy . 
i think of information technology as giving power to the disenfranchised , as reshaping the constellation of international actors , as a soft world giving courage to citizens seeking democratic change under repressive regimes . 
i think of vital channels to the newly minted International Criminal Court and of links between women ' s groups , links that cut across the developing and developed world , links forged in cyberspace . 
i think of the power of the new communications in the land mine campaign , for example , when the Internet gave people around the globe a powerful incentive to work toward shared objectives . 
i think of our young people discovering their ideas , and that ideas and information have become a force more potent than tanks or automatic weapons . 
on this special day , I think back to the General Assembly meeting in Paris , when the first step in the long journey toward a freer , fairer world was taken . 
i think about the power of freedom and the ringing declaration that gave all of mankind a glimpse of what was possible , a declaration that changed the world forever . 
i think of human rights , which are as essential to our lives as air or water - timeless truths that cut across the centuries and give mankind the strength to cross any border , to climb any mountain , to defy any oppressor , no matter how cruel . 
honourable senators , on this fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , we must think with the heart . 
we must remember our humanity and , as Bertrand Russell once counselled , if we do that , we can forget the rest . 
hon. Consiglio Di Nino : 
honourable senators , today , as we mourn the tragic loss of our colleague Shaughnessy Cohen , a lady who had obvious high standards of values and enormous respect for human rights , it is an honour for me to join my colleague and friend Senator Graham in speaking to you on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . 
today , December 10 , 1998 , is the fiftieth anniversary of this powerful testament to freedom , to dignity and to the resilience of the human spirit . 
it is important that Canadians take note of this day for several reasons . 
first , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was conceived as a common achievement for all peoples and all nations . 
this description is both rich and thought - provoking . 
when the declaration is viewed in this way , it is clear that human rights transcend the political experience , state ideology , government or individual leaders . 
they also transcend any barrier of time , space or geography . 
the rights set out in the declaration are universal and timeless . 
no law or decree may limit them . 
the universal declaration is significant since it has inspired the creation and implementation of a number of other protocols , conventions and agreements . 
virtually all endeavours dealing with international human rights refer to the declaration . 
perhaps the most important function of the declaration , however , is that it is a beacon of hope for millions of oppressed people around the world . 
we Canadians are very lucky ; the vast majority of us do not fear for our lives every waking moment ; we do not live in constant fear of torture , enslavement , arbitrary arrest or detention . 
sadly , the same cannot be said for hundreds of millions of men , women and children in too many places around this world . 
yesterday , I co - hosted a press conference for Palden Gyatso , a Tibetan monk who , for some 33 years , was jailed , tortured and enslaved by the Chinese for daring to believe in freedom . 
in 1991 , he was released from jail as a result of a worldwide intervention led by Amnesty International . 
he is this year ' s recipient of the John Humphrey Freedom Award given by the International Centre for Human Rights Development . 
for Palden Gyatso , and all the oppressed peoples of the world , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a ray of hope for emancipation , democracy and , most important , freedom . 
one year ago today , Progressive Conservative senators reflected on the various articles of the universal declaration . 
what have we done to ensure that fundamental human rights are not only affirmed but defended ? 
that is something upon which we should reflect . 
honourable senators , the universal declaration is a shining light that cuts through the darkness of authoritarianism and repression . 
let me remind honourable senators that it was a Canadian citizen , as Senator Graham said a moment ago , Professor John Peters Humphrey , who prepared the draft for this Magna Carta of the 20 th century . 
that was a monumental achievement of which we should be proud , considering Canada ' s long and hallowed tradition of being a global peacekeeper . 
honourable senators , the universal declaration is a benchmark against which international human rights are measured . 
these rights , however , are not universally observed . 
so long as a single person ' s dignity is violated by a government or a regime , we as Canadians must defend the rights contained in the universal declaration loudly , openly , and without the slightest of hesitation . 
hon. Calvin Woodrow Ruck : 
honourable senators , I rise to make a few remarks concerning the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . 
that declaration has had a personal effect on my life as a member of a minority group . 
the opening chapter states that all men are created equal , and they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights , and among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . 
those words do not always apply to minority persons , as many of you are aware . 
we have seen many changes come about since the declaration . 
this has opened many doors to visible minorities . 
i was able to purchase land that previously had been declared out of bounds to members of the black community . 
i was able to raise a family there and see that they were properly educated . 
the winds of change are blowing throughout this country , and the declaration has had a major impact with respect to those winds . 
we have come a long ways . 
we can now go into barbershops in the city of Dartmouth . 
it took a number of years before I was admitted , but human rights law brought that into being . 
in theatres in some parts of Nova Scotia , we could only sit in the balcony . 
things have improved . 
we now have many members of our community working in department stores and in banks as bank clerks . 
there was a time when we could not borrow money from banks , much less work in a bank . 
i am proud to be a Canadian . 
our country has come a long ways , but there is still some ways to go . 
minority people have become members of Parliament . 
not too many years ago that was unheard of , so progress has been made , and I am very proud to stand here this afternoon . 
nuclear Disarmament 
report of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee on Policies Governing Nuclear Weapons 
hon. Douglas Roche : 
honourable senators , I call to your attention two remarkable press conferences that were held this morning , back to back . 
all of the above , with the exception of one that I will come to , strongly supported the committee ' s report , and for good reason . 
the report ' s leading recommendations would , if implemented , put Canada squarely in the body of mounting world opinion that the time has come to move away from the Cold War doctrine of nuclear deterrence . 
i will mention one recommendation contained in the report , namely , that Canada should work with our NATO allies and the New Agenda Coalition - and I know the Leader of the Government will be especially interested in this recommendation since we have been discussing it this fall - to encourage the nuclear weapons states to demonstrate their unequivocal commitment to enter into and conclude negotiations leading to the elimination of nuclear weapons . 
that is just one of the important recommendations that was contained in this report . 
the recommendations reflect the views of the International Court of Justice , the Canberra Commission , leading world military and civilian figures , and the New Agenda Coalition . 
they reflect the views of 92 per cent of Canadians who , in an Angus Reid poll in 1998 , said they wanted Canada to take a leadership role in promoting an international ban on nuclear weapons . 
finally and unfortunately , I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the Reform Party did file a minority report , which is mystifying , because they did not dissent from any of the recommendations but did say that they did not support the broad conclusions of the report . 
in so doing , honourable senators , the Reform Party has separated itself from the international process started by the International Court of Justice , including the non - proliferation treaty signed by 187 nations which imposes a binding legal obligation on all parties to negotiate the complete elimination of nuclear weapons . 
the other four parties , representing 80 per cent of the popular vote in the 1997 election , namely the Liberal Party , the New Democratic Party , the Bloc Qu é b é cois , and the Progressive Conservative Party , all deserve the congratulations of the Senate for contributing to the advancement of global security . 
Newfoundland 
history of Nursing Education in Province 
hon. Joan Cook : 
honourable senators , in June 1998 , the last graduates of the Newfoundland General Hospital School of Nursing received their diplomas , thus ending almost 100 years of educating nurses . 
the alumni of over 3,500 graduates viewed the occasion as an opportunity to celebrate the life of the school and the contribution of its graduates to nursing and health care provincially , nationally , and internationally . 
the theme " Celebrating 95 Years of Leadership in Nursing Education " was chosen to reflect its leadership role both in provincial nursing education and practise . 
in 1902 , Mary Southcott was appointed to establish the first training school for nurses in the colony . 
she was the first to recognize that educated nurses were essential in providing quality patient care . 
in 1903 , four candidates entered the nursing school . 
within 10 years , the school had established such a favourable reputation that Canadian provinces were recruiting General Hospital graduates to work in their hospitals . 
with an increasing enrolment and need for additional learning resources , Mary Southcott succeeded in having a nurses ' residence built in 1911 . 
in 1913 , she formed the Graduate Nurses Association of Newfoundland that established a registry of nurses endorsed by the association . 
Ms Southcott had expected strict adherence to standards , which was to be an underlying value for graduates of the program . 
in 1923 , in order to improve their practice and education , nurses sought registration with the General Council of England and Wales and many graduates began to travel to the United States and Canada to upgrade their qualifications . 
in 1925 , the school established a uniform standard for the education of nurses by adopting Ontario ' s minimum curriculum for nursing education and , in 1926 , the alumni was formed to support professional development of the graduates . 
one of the alumni ' s first acts was to purchase textbooks and journals for the nurses and students , thus establishing one of the finest nursing resource libraries in the colony . 
in 1944 and 1945 , nurses from the General Hospital School of Nursing travelled to Montreal and Toronto to do post - graduate studies in nursing in preparation to teach in the school and to assume leadership positions in the hospital . 
this practice continued until a university nursing program was created in the province in the mid - 1960 s . 
in 1946 , an external review program was conducted by the Council for Nurse Education , in Toronto . 
this was the first review of its kind in the province and set the precedent for the existing approval of provincial schools of nursing by the professional association . 
throughout the 1950 s to 1970 s , the General Hospital School of Nursing established many firsts in nursing education in Newfoundland and Labrador . 
the school was the first to admit male and married students to the program . 
the school was the first to establish an advisory committee that included public and student representation . 
in 1982 , at the Canadian Nurses Association biennial convention in Newfoundland , a graduate of the school of nursing made history in Canadian nursing by proposing that the entry requirement to the nursing profession by the year 2000 would be a university degree . 
throughout its existence , the school has initiated or participated in activities to ensure high standards in nursing education and practice . 
the impact of the school is best reflected in a quote from Joyce Nevitt ' s book , White Caps and Black Bands : 
Mary Southcott created a precedent . 
the school for nurses was established on a sound basis and she would see it grow into one of the finest schools on the North American continent . 
united Nations 
fiftieth Anniversary of the Signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
hon. Th é r è se Lavoie - Roux : 
honourable senators , on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , I would like to take a few moments to draw your attention to the Convention on the Rights of the Child . 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child is the most heavily ratified human rights treaty in history . 
its own history goes back to 1979 , the International Year of the Child . 
the convention was adopted unanimously on November 20 , 1989 by the United Nations General Assembly . 
since then , all member states , except two , have ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child . 
this human rights instrument is exceptional in the way it sets out the rights of children , their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and establishes the legal criteria and moral requirements to protect their rights . 
in short , the convention defines what the world wants for its children . 
the convention ' s ability to protect the rights of children depends first and foremost on the support 
the United Nations committee on the rights of the child lies at the heart of the process and is comprised of elected international experts . 
the committee oversees the implementation of the convention and recommends to governments the measures that give children a higher priority . 
a coalition of over 50 NGOs are currently preparing a report with representatives of the Canadian government . 
the report will be tabled with the committee on the rights of the child in June 1999 . 
in addition , Canada is attempting to append two optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child . 
the first concerns child soldiers and prohibits the recruiting and participation of children in armed conflicts . 
in the convention , a child is defined as a person under 18 years of age . 
not that long ago , Canadian soldiers 16 and 17 years old were still taking part in armed combat . 
the Department of National Defence has since revised its policy and raised the legal age for taking part in hostilities to 18 , thus reflecting Canada ' s agreement with the convention ' s principles . 
the second protocol establishes measures to criminalize the worst forms of child exploitation : the sale of children , child prostitution and child pornography . 
the Criminal Code has been amended so that those who engage in child sex tourism can be prosecuted , although more needs to be done . 
the reports we are hearing from the Dominican Republic in particular , as well as from many other countries , are terrible . 
it is hoped that this protocol will encourage other countries to adopt similar measures against the exploitation of children . 
do we have the best interests of the child at heart when we allow the minimum wage and social assistance to drop below the cost of living or when we amend custody and access legislation ? 
do the cuts in child welfare , education programs and health services have the best interests of the child at heart ? 
our children deserve the best there is . 
let us make their rights our priority every day . 
the Honourable John Lynch - Staunton 
congratulations on Fifth Anniversary of Assuming Leadership of Progressive Conservative Party in the Senate 
hon. Ron Ghitter : 
honourable senators , today we celebrate the 50 th anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . 
those of us on this side of the house wish to note that December 15 is also an anniversary of significance to all of us , that being the fifth anniversary of the leadership of Senator John Lynch - Staunton as our leader in the Senate . 
some Hon. Senators : 
hear , hear ! 
senator Berntson : 
four more years ! 
senator Ghitter : 
when Senator Lynch - Staunton first took over the leadership of the PC Senate caucus from Senator Murray who did such an outstanding job , it turned out he not only had the responsibility of providing leadership in his Senate capacity , but also for the PC Party generally , as we were going through a rebuilding process with only two members in the House . 
it was here in the Senate that such issues as Pearson airport , Somalia , the helicopter debacle , APEC and countless others drew the attention of all of us and challenged the many talents of Senator Lynch - Staunton . 
he performed admirably and he continues do so . 
senator Lynch - Staunton is a Canadian dedicated to his country , his province , the Senate of Canada and his political party . 
he has proven his dedication in countless ways by his tireless work in the Senate and in our caucus . 
when Senator Lynch - Staunton stands up to speak , all senators in the Senate listen because he is worth listening to . 
he walks his talk , he leads by example , and we are all enriched by his efforts and commitment . 
you enjoy our support , our love , and our admiration . 
five more years , at least , under your leadership would be most welcome . 
national Defence 
commemoration of Commissioning of New Warship HMCS Saskatoon 
hon. David Tkachuk : 
honourable senators , my wife , Sharon , and I had the opportunity to attend the commissioning of the HMCS Saskatoon this past Saturday . 
i was impressed by our navy ' s newest ship and proud that it was named after my home town of Saskatoon . 
senators may not be aware that one of the highest honours the navy can bestow on a city is to name a ship after it . 
it provides a link to communities across the country and ships frequently develop their own personalities , drawing , in large part , from the characteristics of the community for which they are named . 
the HMSC Saskatoon is Canada ' s newest warship . 
she left Halifax Harbour on Friday , August 28 for her new home in Esquimalt , B.C. , via the Panama Canal . 
the ship is under the command of Lieutenant - Commander E . M. J . - Mark - Richardson and will be crewed by 42 men and women of the Naval Reserve . 
the HMCS Saskatoon will conduct missions ranging from sovereignty patrols , search and rescue and mine countermeasures , to Naval Reserve training , route survey and assistance to other government departments . 
i am sure all honourable senators will join me in congratulating Vice - Admiral G . R . Maddison , Chief of the Maritime Staff , and Rear - Admiral A . D . Buck , Commander Maritime Forces Pacific , on a great commissioning ceremony . 
the base at Esquimalt is to be commended for their organization . 
also , special thanks to Mayor Dayday of Saskatoon for a wonderful reception . 
on behalf of all citizens of Saskatoon , I want to extend a special thanks to the commissioning volunteer committee chaired by John Duerkop , Captain John Dalzell , Chris Dekker , Joan Steckhan and , of course , former lieutenant governor Sylvia Fedoruk , who was the sponsor . 
as well , thanks to all the businesses and organizations which lent their support to the celebration . 
i love the blessing that was read at the launching . 
since it is the Christmas season , and considering the tragedy that took place in the House of Commons yesterday and the fragility of human life , I will read it into the record : 
united Nations 
fiftieth Anniversary of the Signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
hon. G é rald - A . 
honourable senators , I should like to say a few words on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the role our highest court has played in this area . 
in a June 1998 decision , Pushpanathan v. Canada , Mr. Justice Bastarache , speaking for the majority , writes : 
for example , determinations by the International Court of Justice may be compelling . 
in the case United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran , the court found : 
to wrongfully deprive human beings of their freedom and to subject them to physical constraint in conditions of hardship is in itself manifestly incompatible with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations , as well as with the fundamental principles enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . 
in Keegstra , the Court wrote : 
generally speaking , the international human rights obligations taken on by Canada reflect the values and principles of a free and democratic society , and thus those values and principles that underlie the Charter itself ... 
in Kindler , it wrote : 
canada ' s commitment to human dignity has a lengthy and respected history in international affairs . 
this commitment is exemplified by its accession to the United Nations Charter on November 9 , 1945 , its vote in favour of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on December 10 , 1948 ... 
these few words explain our highest court ' s recourse to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in interpreting and applying our constitutional and quasi - constitutional laws in Canada . 
everything would indicate that this practice will continue for a long time to come in our country . 
hon. Marcel Prud ' homme : 
honourable senators , on the subject of this great and important Universal Declaration of Human Rights , I will draw on the Chicoutimi paper Le Quotidien , which said : 
there has never been as much killing , pillaging and raping as there is now . 
and we are talking about great conflicts . 
in The Ottawa Citizen , we were reminded that it is a good thing in Canada to look back in history . 
... was unenthusiastic about the declaration , so much so as to abstain in a key vote on its adoption . 
denounced for doing this both by the United Kingdom and the United States , the Canadian government did a quick volte - face and endorsed the declaration at the U . N . General Assembly . 
there are many items dealing with this matter on our Orders of the Day , one of which is the excellent report of our colleague Senator Stewart . 
another will be put forward later by Senator Andreychuk . 
i only wish that we will reflect today on the meaning of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . 
i hope and pray that we would not be selective . 
as I get older , I love to repeat this lesson , taught to me when I was very young by my father . 
you cannot pick and choose . 
if you believe in the universality of something , you do not pick and choose . 
you believe in the universality or you remain silent . 
today , on the eve of the visit of President Clinton to the Middle East , I want to again be on record for the forgotten people , the Palestinian people . 
when a cause is just , it does not die . 
a just cause does not pass away . 
this has been haunting us ever since November 19 , 1947 , when two prominent Canadians , Lester B . Pearson , as an ambassador for Canada , and Ivan Rand , were highly responsible for a report that gave birth to a resolution called Resolution No. 181 . 
that resolution was voted after a lot of twisting and a lot of hesitation by a vote of 33 in favour , 13 against and 10 abstentions , mostly by Christian countries , to create , on the land of Palestine , two states , one for the Jews and one for the Palestinians . 
it seems to me that Canadians have forgotten what they did on November 29 , 1947 . 
we voted to make two countries on someone ' s land . 
i accept the resolution . 
i accept that it means two states , but look at where we are today : 
there is only one state ; people are killing each other with passion over a piece of land which should represent peace and justice for all on earth . 
i would hope that some colleague of mine will pay a little more attention to what has taken place since 1947 in that part of the world , which seems to be forgotten by everyone when we make speeches on human rights . 
everything that takes place in the Middle East has its birth on that day . 
the situation in Algeria is the culmination of hate . 
what happened in Iraq and in Libya with nuclear arms has its birth in that region of the world because one of the powers there has nuclear arms . 
we have an arms race of the same kind that took place between the United States and the Soviet Union in the old days . 
i would hope today , as we reflect on every other atrocity that is taking place , we will pay attention to some people who beg for just a piece of land that is theirs , who beg for water that is being taken away from them , who beg for justice . 
i am not defending any political regime nor any organization or association , as corrupt as they may be on both sides . 
i am defending the just cause of giving justice to people who have been begging and begging and who only receive in answer a kind silence . 
as the Honourable Senator Heath Macquarrie used to say , I find it strange that scholars and politicians and parliamentarians have an opinion on everything else but if I ask them what they think of the Palestinian people , they start talking about hockey , religion or sex . 
they all try to escape talking about what is contaminating not only the Middle East but sometimes contaminating relationships here between senators and between us and members of the House of Commons . 
i have gone through that for 35 years . 
i have seen that contamination . 
i have never answered back because I believe in being good . 
i believe that if we are good , we will understand that there is a part of the world that is also asking for justice . 
today we should at least have a moment of reflection for those people and we should work a little bit harder to find a solution . 
that is Canada ' s role at the United Nations Security Council . 
it will be very interesting to see how Canada will vote in the next two years as a member of the Security Council . 
port of Halifax 
congratulations on Selection as Megaport Finalist 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , may I have leave to make a very brief statement about the Halifax port and the post - Panamax vessels . 
i have already made an intervention under Senators ' Statements . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
is it agreed , honourable senators ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
senator Graham : 
i have just received word that the Port of Halifax has been selected as one of three finalists for the location of the new Maersk / Sealand container super - terminal . 
i have here the official announcement from the Sealand and Maersk companies . 
the finalists are the ports of Halifax , Nova Scotia ; Newark , New Jersey ; and Baltimore , Maryland . 
the carriers are still reviewing if one megaport is the most effective option or if volumes should be split over more than one northeast port facility to meet their service and cost requirements . 
of course , this is very good news for Nova Scotia . It is wonderful news for Atlantic Canada . 
Canadians , of course , will eagerly await the selection of the winner . 
certainly , it is still to be determined whether one port will get all of the business or whether it will be shared by more than one port , as indicated by the official press release . 
the Province of Nova Scotia has made a request to the federal government for financial assistance . 
this is one of my top priorities as a regional minister and I will continue to work with my cabinet colleagues to make it a priority for the Government of Canada . 
investing in the future of the Port of Halifax , I am sure all honourable senators would agree , is an important step towards getting the economic fundamentals right in our region by creating opportunity , jobs and growth for Atlantic Canadians and , indeed , for a very large part of our country . 
the Senate 
provision in Rules for Ministers ' Statements 
hon. Lowell Murray : 
honourable senators , I rise not to comment on the minister ' s statement but to point out that when we brought in the new rules a few years back , we neglected to provide an item under the daily routine of business for " Ministers ' Statements , " as distinct from " Senators ' Statements . " 
i suppose a minister could make a statement under " Tabling of Documents , " but what the statement just given is not technically the tabling of a document . 
it occurs to me that this oversight should be corrected soon in our rules . 
while I am on my feet , I want to ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether he will take advantage of the opportunity that is his now to make the statement which he promised to make on the subject of the Cape Breton Development Corporation and its future . 
this is a statement which he undertook to make before we rise for the Christmas holidays . 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
before the day is out , I do hope to ask leave to revert to statements so that I can make some comments with respect to the future of the Cape Breton Development Corporation . 
hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
the point made by Senator Murray is valid . 
the reason for changing the rules to bring in a legitimate spot on the scroll for ministerial statements would be to allow time for comment from the opposition .

question PERIOD 
solicitor General 
security Arrangements at APEC Conference - Role of Privy Council Office - Government Position 
hon. No ë l A . Kinsella ( Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , the " fortress of darkness , " otherwise known as the Langevin Block , houses the Prime Minister ' s Office and the Privy Council Office , and the apprentices of the " forces of darkness " all . 
in a document B - 50 , contained in the set of documents that were attached to the letter from the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association , which all honourable senators now have , we find a memorandum to the Prime Minister from the Clerk of the Privy Council , Jocelyne Bourgon , dated September 19 , 1997 , in which she tells the Prime Minister that President Suharto may not come to the APEC meeting in Vancouver because the Indonesians are : 
... intent upon avoiding any embarrassment to the President . 
the memo states further that : 
ambassador Parwoto is apparently sceptical about the degree to which Canada is prepared to take action to avoid embarrassment to President Suharto . 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , as my honourable friend knows , the host country for any APEC conference is responsible for the security of all of the delegates , be they heads of state or members of a particular delegation , just as any host country would be responsible for the security of our Prime Minister . 
i am not aware of the particular role that the Privy Council Office would play specifically in providing security arrangements , but I am sure that all of that information would come forward as soon as the Public Complaints Commission is allowed to get on with its work , and to hear from all of the relevant witnesses . 
senator Kinsella : 
honourable senators , would the Leader of the Government in the Senate advise us whether he recognizes in this documentation the distinction that is clear between the matter of security , on the one hand , and to use Jocelyn Bourgon ' s language , the more important avoiding of embarrassment ? 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , I think security and embarrassment in this particular situation could obviously be linked , because if proper security arrangements were not provided for a visiting head of state , that could be highly embarrassing to the host country . 
senator Kinsella : 
honourable senators , how does the Leader of the Government explain that , as the documents point out , when the RCMP had determined the control lines for security purposes , only after a visit from officials in the Prime Minister ' s Office was that security line changed and pushed back . 
the RCMP had not predetermined , on a security basis , where the line had to be . 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , I am sure the answer to that question will come in testimony before the Public Complaints Commission . 
however , as indicated earlier , the President of the University of British Columbia had expressed some concern about security to the Prime Minister ' s Office , and a representative of the Prime Minister ' s Office acted accordingly , and swiftly . 
i understand that the lines to which my honourable friend refers were adjusted accordingly , and were very satisfactory to the President of the University of British Columbia , on whose property the events were being held . 
SSecurity Arrangements at APEC Conference - Details Contained in Documents Tabled - Government Position 
hon. Lowell Murray : 
honourable senators , I have not been taking part in these exchanges in recent weeks , but in the last few minutes I have been passing time leafing through some of this documentation . 
i should like to ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate about a document that apparently came from the NCO in charge of the APEC Threat Assessment Joint Intelligence Group . 
two members of the media attending UBC last night as invited observers were noted to be overly sympathetic to the APEC Alert protesters . 
both subjects have had their accreditation seized . 
the report goes on : 
the first subject is Dr. Joan RUSSOW federal leader of the Green Party . 
second subject Dennis PORTER ' s accreditation states he is a journalist employed by Working TV . 
it should be noted that PORTER ' s hair as of Nov . 22 was bright orange . 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
it could be all three . 
senator Berntson : 
there is no answer , so save your breath . 
senator Graham : 
it may be that hair tint could be one of the subjects to be investigated when the Public Complaints Commission has an opportunity to get on with its hearings . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
spoken like a true prince . 
parks Canada 
delineation of Boundary of Tuktut Nogait National Park - Government Position 
hon. Willie Adams : 
honourable senators , my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate . 
between cabinet and Parks Canada , the Inuvialuit in the last couple of years has tried to negotiate the boundary of Tuktut Nogait National Park . 
how much longer will the cabinet and Parks Canada ignore the Inuvialuit ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I do not think that the cabinet nor Parks Canada have ever ignored any representations made by that particular community . 
i respect the concerns of Senator Adams on this particular issue . 
i have some fleeting familiarity with the area . 
not too many people have visited an area such as Paulatuk . 
i am among those who have had a wonderful time in that particular part of the North . 
i did so some several years ago , along with the then commissioner of the Northwest Territories , Stuart Hodgson . 
i have a lasting impression of the wonderful hospitality of the people in that area , and how concerned and cooperative they were with respect to the future of the area . 
honourable senators , as Leader of the Government in the Senate I would be very happy to take any representations made by honourable senators to my cabinet colleagues . 
i wish to assure Senator Adams and others that I will put forward my best efforts to ensure that justice is done in all federal matters . 
senator Adams : 
honourable senators , in the last hour and a half , we have heard many good things about human rights , but what about the rights of aboriginal people ? 
we do not have a voice . 
that is my concern . 
the Inuvialuit own the property already . 
the Government of Canada and Parks Canada have been ignoring them for the last couple of years , even after an agreement was signed . 
all they are asking for is a piece of land . 
we have all the information you tabled . 
yesterday , Senator Carstairs read into the record a letter from Minister Andy Mitchell . 
it was exactly the same thing as we heard from him before . 
it did not mean anything ; the $ 2 million means nothing . 
he had money for that before . 
later today , we will vote on Bill C - 38 . 
the Inuvialuit merely want to negotiate a piece of property , but Parks Canada says an agreement is already in place . 
however , those people still own the land . 
they did sign over a piece of land for the park , but not for the boundary . 
senator Graham : 
i would urge all honourable colleagues in the chamber to read carefully the letter that was sent to me , dated December 9 , from the Honourable Andy Mitchell , Secretary of State for Parks Canada . 
national Finance 
possible New Fringe Benefits Policy - Golf Club Membership Fees Paid for Crown Corporations Employees 
hon. Roch Bolduc : 
honourable senators , will the Leader of the Government in the Senate tell us whether there is a new fringe benefits policy concerning the paying , with public money , of membership fees to golf courses for employees of Crown corporations and your officials ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I am certainly not aware of any such policy . 
crown corporations generally act at arm ' s length from the government , and develop their own policies under which they operate . 
senator Bolduc : 
honourable senators , does the Leader of the Government mean that the government will not intervene but will go on doing that , while we are cutting funds to the hospitals in the provinces ? 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , I am not aware of the point that Senator Bolduc is trying to make . 
north Atlantic Treaty Organization 
reiteration of Policy on Disarmament within Proper Forum - Government Position 
hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , I wish to ask a follow - up question to the one I raised yesterday as the time allotted for Question Period was running out . 
i also support the initiatives of Senator Roche in that regard . 
however , my concern is for a tradition and practice in NATO that we do not act unilaterally , or form opinions that may prejudice our partners until those issues have been properly discussed within the NATO context . 
will the Leader of the Government in the Senate undertake to ask the Minister of Foreign Affairs to restrict his comments on the changes within the nuclear policy to the right forum , namely , the forum within the NATO context ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I presume the honourable senator is referring to the article which appeared in The Globe and Mail , written by Mr. Sallot . 
i should attempt to clarify the Foreign Minister ' s comments . 
the author claims to have cited the text of Mr. Axworthy ' s interventions in the North Atlantic Council meeting in Brussels , as well as notes that he took from a telephone interview , presumably with Mr. Axworthy . 
the article states that Canada has set itself up to lead a potentially divisive debate between the NATO non - nuclear states and the Alliance ' s nuclear powers , such as the U.S. , the U . K . , France , and others . 
presumably , those are the comments to which Senator Andreychuk is referring . 
the text of the Foreign Minister ' s speech which Mr. Sallot cites does not appear to be what Mr. Axworthy actually said within the confines of the North Atlantic Council meeting . 
we understand that the minister ' s actual intervention did not address nuclear matters at length . 
he focused instead , as I understand it , on the progress that NATO has made in responding to new challenges , such as the crisis in Kosovo . 
senator Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , if I understand what the minister is indicating , then all issues of changing NATO policy will be discussed within the confines of NATO with our partners . 
my concern is that if we put our position out unilaterally first and then move on it , then others will do so ; others who , perhaps , do not have our objectives in mind . 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , as an active member of the Alliance , Canada is participating in a review of the strategic concept that is currently under way . 
the review will address a wide range of issues , including the changed environment of Euro - Atlantic security , NATO ' s role in peacekeeping operations and responding to the spread of weapons of mass destruction . 
we expect that the revised strategic concept will be ready to be issued at the next NATO summit which will be held in April . 
transport 
port of Halifax - Selection as Megaport Finalist - Request for Tabling of News Release 
hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
honourable senators , my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate . 
it has to do with his brief indication to us of the very welcome news that Halifax is one of three cities short - listed for post - Panamax operations . 
i am curious as to whether or not the announcement by the minister contains any details as to when the final decision will be taken , or whether there is any detail with respect to the level of financial commitment that the Liberal government is prepared to put forward . 
as honourable senators will be aware , Nova Scotia , with 3 per cent of the population of Canada , has already absorbed 16 per cent of the federal cuts . 
is the minister in a position now to table a document ? 
it did not appear that the minister was reading from a document . 
has he simply been apprised of this information , or does he have at hand a press release or any other document which he might care to table in the Senate ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
i would be happy to do that , honourable senators . 
this is a news release by way of Canada Newswire . 
it was just sent into me in the chamber . 
any other comments that I made were purely on my own behalf . 
i would be happy to table the news release , if it is agreeable with all honourable senators . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
is it only in English ? 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , I will not table it because I do not have a translation of it . 
however , I would be happy to distribute a copy of the release . 
port of Halifax - Selection as Megaport Finalist - Requirement for Federal Funding and Public Consultation on Location of Post - Panamax Facility - Government Position 
hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
honourable senators , would the minister undertake to include with the document which he will distribute some indication of the current federal position with respect to funding ? 
at the same time , would the minister urge upon the government the sensitivity and the sensibility of public hearings being held for the purpose of discussing the location of the new intended pier facility , the post - Panamax facility ? 
there seems to have been nothing short of an arbitrary decision to extend the pier requirements in the Fairview Cove area . 
in other words , the facility could be built a lot cheaper , and the residents of Halifax , Dartmouth , and the Bedford Basin area should have some public way of making some serious input . 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , that is an important intervention by the Honourable Senator Forrestall . 
with respect to the government ' s current position , my colleague might understand that I would not be rising in my place and talking about a statement of this kind if I had not been raising this matter with my colleagues . 
i have been working continuously with my colleagues at the federal level . 
i detect a great deal of support for this project , not just in that particular region but also across the country . 
it is not Halifax in competition with the rest of the country ; it is Canada versus the United States . 
with regard to the sensitivity of this issue that my honourable friend raises as it relates directly to the location and the land that might be made available , I will bring that matter to the attention of those people who are most directly responsible : the port corporation , the Province of Nova Scotia , and those at the federal level who will be working on this particular file . 
senator Forrestall : 
honourable senators , I have one final supplementary question . 
i thank the minister for many courtesies he has extended to me over the last year . 
i assure him that I would not raise these matters unless I too believed that they were of a deep and continuing concern . 
could the minister tell us why the federal government has been so reluctant to accept the nominees to the port corporation . 
as he will be aware , there has been some concern about the rejection of nominees from at least two of the ports affected . 
senator Graham : 
honourable senator , that matter is under continuing discussion . 
when the details become more readily available , I will be glad to bring forward a report . 
delayed Answer to Oral Question 
hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I have a response to a question raised in the Senate on November 26 , 1998 by the Honourable Senator Michael J . Forrestall regarding the Aurora Maritime Patrol aircraft fleet . 
national DEFENCE 
Aurora Maritime Patrol Aircraft Fleet - Replacement of Kapton Wiring in Fleet and other Aircraft - Status of Life Extension Program - Government Position 
( response to question raised by Hon. J . Michael Forrestall on November 26 , 1998 ) 
all 18 Aurora aircraft have polyimide wiring ( Kapton is a trademark of the DuPont Company for polyimide wiring ) . 
in 1992 , a phased wire replacement program was initiated for the Aurora to replace the polyimide wiring located in areas most susceptible to premature degradation as a result of exposure to severe environmental conditions . 
this replacement program was completed in November 1998 . In a continuing effort to ensure flight safety , a detailed analysis is being conducted of the remaining polyimide wiring located in areas of the aircraft where the wire is less susceptible to degradation . 
it should also be noted that , as part of the normal depot level inspection and repair cycle , exposed aircraft wiring continues to be visually inspected for defects . 
the three Arcturus maritime patrol aircraft that were manufactured in the early 1990 s do not have polyimide wiring . 
2 . The Aurora Life Extension Project ( ALEP ) has yet to be approved . 
orders OF THE DAY 
Nunavut Act 
bill to Amend - Second Reading 
on the Order : 
resuming debate on the motion of the Honourable Senator P é pin , seconded by the Honourable Senator Poulin , for the second reading of Bill C - 57 , to amend the Nunavut Act with respect to the Nunavut Court of Justice and to amend other Acts in consequence . 
hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , since Senator P é pin has put forward the elements of the bill so fully , I do not propose to detail them at any length . 
this bill arises out of the creation of Nunavut , a policy that was started by the previous government after much consultation with the aboriginal and northern communities . 
the concept of Nunavut grew out of a long and extensive record of consultation and expressed wishes by northern people . 
they have identified their own problems - social problems , financial problems , cultural problems , and problems as citizens within Canada . 
Nunavut is a concept and a process they have arrived at , and I believe that all Canadians are supportive of the Nunavut process at this time . 
this bill deals particularly with the creation of the Nunavut Court of Justice . 
the he issue of justice is one of the most fundamental and important issues facing northern people . 
i have personally had the opportunity to travel in the North as part of the judicial process . 
it is one of the most interesting to see and one of the most difficult to bear . 
court means that judges , prosecutors , defence counsel , court workers , court reporters , and court clerks all travel from settlement to settlement . 
the same concepts of justice the we have in urban areas are expected to come into play . 
often there are delays , understandable delays , because the court attempts to serve so many isolated settlements . 
" flattening " the courts , creating a more responsive system and integrating more people from the North into their own justice system is a laudable goal , and Bill C - 57 addresses that goal . 
i look forward to our committee having an opportunity to study this bill , clause - by - clause , to ensure that what we are attempting to do can be done and administered by the provisions of this proposed legislation . 
our committee will try to ensure that we can accomplish the ends set out in this bill . 
i would , however , remark in passing that justice for the northern people will require more than what is contained in Bill C - 57 . 
it will demand proper training and access to education so that the judicial system in the North can become a truly northern justice system involving aboriginal peoples . 
it will take some time , it will take some training , and it will take an enormous effort by the justice system throughout Canada to support this new process . 
honourable senators , I know that we require unique answers to address questions of sentencing in the North . 
perhaps , in time , we will have rules and processes in place that fit the aboriginal people in the North and the northern people . 
one need only live or travel in the North to know that the challenges in the North are not only related to distance . 
they are multidimensional , and many problems can only be solved by those who live in those communities . 
thankfully , there is a growing sense of awareness of community responsibility and community creativity that is allowing for the kinds of responses to the justice system that will truly work for our aboriginal peoples . 
i hope that the provisions of this proposed legislation will not be used as a tool by which the government will cut back funding to northern justice . 
in fact , this should be an opportunity to increase the moneys and the access to expertise that will be required to be put it into place . 
we must understand that crime is not the root cause of many problems in the North . 
the lack of integration of the people into modern society is a large part of the problem . 
another part of the problem can be related to what is contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . 
our agenda as it relates to our aboriginal peoples has been left unfinished . 
if we address the issues within the aboriginal concept , we would have less difficulty in the justice system . 
i am pleased that the government has introduced this bill within the time limits and that our committee will have time to study it in detail . 
we will have an opportunity to put questions to the minister on the entire concept of justice and not just the court systems in the North . 
i am pleased to speak in favour of the concept of this bill . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , it was moved by Honourable Senator P é pin , seconded by Honourable Senator Poulin , that this bill be read the second time . 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
motion agreed to and bill read second time . 
referred to Committee 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , when shall this bill be read the third time ? 
on motion of Senator P é pin , bill referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs . 
tobacco Act 
bill to Amend - Third Reading 
honourable senators , I am pleased to address the Senate on the government ' s proposed amendment to the Tobacco Act . 
i should like to take this opportunity to commend the Minister of Health for this important amendment which , if passed , will make Canadian tobacco legislation among the toughest in the world . 
honourable senators , let me note that when the minister appeared before the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs yesterday evening , he responded in a positive manner to a request made to him . 
the minister took under serious advisement the suggestion that the Senate be consulted on proposed regulations under the Tobacco Act in the same manner as the House of Commons . 
in giving the committee his assurance that he will consult with his colleagues on this proposal , the minister has demonstrated his willingness to work in a non - partisan way to reduce youth smoking . 
honourable senators , this amendment is good news for all Canadians , particularly Canadian youth . 
we all know that youth are the most tragic casualties of tobacco use and addiction , and we know that youth are the most vulnerable to tobacco promotion . 
today , more than one in four of our young people smoke . 
half of these young smokers will die prematurely from smoking - related causes . 
this is why the government ' s priority in developing this amendment and in its overall tobacco strategy has been young people . 
the amendments eventually ban the promotion of tobacco sponsorship . 
that is combined with a reaffirmation of the government ' s commitment to spend $ 100 million on initiatives to reduce tobacco use . 
this is a huge step forward in our battle against smoking . 
clearly , the most significant portion of this amendment is a proposal for a total ban on tobacco sponsorship promotion following a five - year transition period . 
currently , sponsorship promotion allows tobacco companies to link their deadly products with exciting events , such as music festivals , tennis tournaments , fashion shows , and motor racing . 
these sponsorships provide an opportunity for embedded advertising that creates a friendly familiarity between tobacco and music and sports enthusiasts , many of whom are children and adolescents . 
these positive images of tobacco are precisely what young people need to feel reassured about smoking . 
this is why the government ' s amendment to the Tobacco Act is so crucial to our efforts to protect the health of Canadian youth . 
by introducing a ban on the promotion of tobacco sponsorship at sports and cultural events , this amendment effectively breaks the link between lifestyle events and smoking . 
as Minister Rock has observed , this is a very significant achievement . 
honourable senators , with the proposal of a complete ban on tobacco sponsorship and a substantial investment in public education , the government is demonstrating its commitment to protecting the health of Canadians , particularly young people . 
these measures also highlight the government ' s desire to work in partnership with groups from across society to create a smoke - free future for Canada ' s youth . 
i call on all members of this house to join me in supporting this important amendment , which represents a major step in building a safer , healthier and more productive future for Canadians . 
hon. Colin Kenny : 
honourable senators , I rise to speak at third reading of Bill C - 42 . 
i congratulate Senator Mahovlich on successfully steering his first bill through the intricacies of the chamber and on his excellent speech . 
i must confess that I have some concerns about the direction the government is taking in terms of tobacco policy . 
i stand here knowing that 40,000 Canadians die from smoking each year . 
i stand here knowing that 85 per cent of those who smoke make that decision before the age of 19 . 
i also stand here knowing that there is nothing in Bill C - 71 , or in Bill C - 42 , the amendment to Bill C - 71 , that provides for funds to address this problem of youth smoking . 
more to the point , the federal government collects $ 2.3 billion a year in excise taxes from tobacco , some of which has been specifically designated to combat youth smoking , yet the government is not spending that money today . 
in the last fiscal year , of the total of $ 10 million that was set aside , the government only spent 55 per cent of the amount set aside for enforcement and it only spent 2 per cent of the amount set aside for youth education . 
i feel a sense of mixed emotions regarding Bill C - 42 . 
on the one hand , if we just left the Tobacco Act as it is , we would have had bans starting last October . 
bill C - 42 pushes the bans out further - five years further , in fact . 
that is a problem , because in each of those five years , we will see more people die , more young children addicted and very little happening . 
on the other hand , Bill C - 42 does contain some good news , in that it brings in a total ban on sponsorship , which did not exist under the old Tobacco Act . 
that is not good enough . 
this problem is one that comes up time after time on pieces of legislation that come before a wide variety of committees . 
senators who have been serving here for a while have seen frequently legislation of this kind come over after it has been reported back to the other place or is dealt with in the other place after it was passed . 
it is my view that we should not receive legislation if the reporting will only go to the other place or if the regulations will only be dealt with in the other place . 
i must confess that I have been party to asking for those comfort letters in the past . 
they are not worth the paper they are written on . 
i have received those comfort letters and I have been told that I have had the minister ' s commitment . 
ministers change and you go back to the next minister and the message you get is : " Well , that was then and this is now . " 
in Bill C - 42 , we have what I hope is the last bill that we will accept that provides for information going to only one of the two chambers . 
i believe that the only way we can correct this problem is if , collectively , when we see a piece of legislation coming before us like that , we say : " No , we are sorry , but we will amend it and we will send it back to you , fixed up , so that it reports to both chambers . " 
if we send that message loudly and clearly enough , and if enough of us do so it now , then the the Commons will not send us legislation such as this in the first place and we will not have to send it back . 
on balance , I do not have difficulty with Bill C - 42 . 
that is something that is probably worthwhile and merits the support of the house . 
i do have some difficulty with the Tobacco Act . 
it is incomplete . 
it reflects an incomplete strategy . 
it does not reflect the appropriate level of commitment that this government and this Parliament owe to Canadians . 
i believe that in the coming months we should address this issue more thoroughly , more comprehensively , and come forward with better proposals to deal with " youth smoking . " 
hon. G é rald - A . 
honourable senators , I have a few words to say on the legal and constitutional issue involving Bill C - 42 . 
we all know that Canada ' s Parliament can legislate on substances that present a danger because of its jurisdiction over criminal matters . 
tobacco presents a health hazard . 
canada ' s Parliament is inspired to intervene in this matter , particularly because it has considerable legislative authority , in my opinion . 
the provinces , of course , have jurisdiction in health matters and they too can intervene , but they do not intervene in the same way and for the same reasons as Parliament . 
they are in their field , that is property and civil law under section 92.13 , 
whereas the federal government bases its legislative jurisdiction in criminal matters on section 91.27 . 
another problem is that of tobacco advertising . 
a total ban on advertising contravenes the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms under freedom of expression , but a relative and not absolute ban is acceptable according to current case law at the highest legal level . 
i am glad that we covered this thoroughly in the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs because the issue has not been resolved . 
that having been said , I personally find the bill perfectly acceptable . 
hon. Lorna Milne : 
honourable senators , I want to add briefly to this discussion of Bill C - 42 and to reinforce what Senator Mahovlich has said . 
while this bill was passed without amendment this morning after a lengthy committee meeting last night , your committee does have a concern in relation to this bill . 
it is a concern that has been raised , as Senator Kenny has pointed out , many times in this place and in our committee . 
according to section 42.1 of the Tobacco Act , proposed regulations must only be presented to the other place for review . 
frankly , the committee slipped up when we considered the first Tobacco Act . 
i asked the minister to make a commitment to change this situation , even though it was not specifically part of this present bill . 
while he refused - justifiably , I believe - to directly commit himself to such a change , Minister Rock promised to take the issue under advisement . 
to quote the minister : 
furthermore , the minister promised to consult with his colleagues about the possibility of a change in government policy on the issue parliamentary review of regulations . 
honourable senators , this is an important issue for this place . 
as a chamber of sober second thought , we must be included in any regulatory review process that the other house is included in . 
i shall be sending a letter to the minister to remind him of his commitment on this issue and to emphasize that members of this committee are awaiting his response . 
hon. Consiglio Di Nino : 
honourable senators , I wish to ask a question . 
i am delighted with that I have heard . 
i am in total agreement with my friend Senator Kenny . 
this is not something that has recently been happening . 
it happened with the previous government as well . 
would Senator Milne consider making her letter a letter of discomfort ? 
senator Milne : 
i can assure the honourable senator that I shall make the letter as sharp as possible . 
hon. Serge Joyal : 
honourable senators , I rise this afternoon in support of Bill C - 42 to share with you some comments and deep conviction . 
last night , we had the opportunity to receive the Honourable Minister of Health . 
our chairman , the Honourable Senator Milne , exercised leadership , dedication and ability which is vested in her capacity as the chair over our work . 
she took upon herself to ask for the minister the following : 
since we are talking about the regulation and since the minister was talking about the regulation in response to Senator Kenny ' s question , this committee has lately been asking ministers who come before us to ensure that both the other place and the Senate are treated equally in the matter of the bills that come before it . 
when I look back through Bill C - 71 , this did not happen in that when you do come down with regulations you must only lay them before the House of Commons . 
i think it might be appropriate , certainly not in the form of an amendment , but in a commitment , that when you lay them before the House of Commons , as now has been put into other bills , you also lay them before the Senate . 
Mr. Rock : 
are you inviting me to make that commitment ? 
the Chairman : 
Yes. 
Mr. Rock : 
i will not give you a commitment at this moment , but I will be happy to take it under advisement . 
it is something I should consider , and I will respond to you in due course once I have had that opportunity . 
honourable senators , I am appalled . 
i have been sitting in this chamber for one year . 
during that time , we have dealt with Bill C - 52 , the comprehensive nuclear test - ban treaty bill ; and Bill C - 3 , the DNA bill . 
those two bills contain exactly the same provisions barring us from receiving the annual or five - year implementation report . 
last night , we were studying amendments to the tobacco bill adopted less than a year and a half ago . 
that bill does not respect our role under the Constitution . 
this is not a fantasy of the Honourable Senator Milne pleading with a minister to get the regulations . 
senator Milne is respecting the Constitution of Canada . 
i shall quote Chapter IV of the Canadian Constitution which is entitled " Legislative Power , " the marginal note of which reads , " Constitution of Parliament of Canada . " 
there shall be One Parliament for Canada , consisting of the Queen , an Upper House styled the Senate , and the House of Commons . 
it shall be lawful for the Queen , by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate and House of Commons ... 
honourable senators , our role , privileges and powers are on the same footing as those of the House of Commons . 
i respectfully submit that if we do not live up to those standards , we should not expect to be treated equally by the other place . 
we will receive bills containing provisions such as the one the Honourable Senator Milne raised last night . 
we will receive other bills , such as the one sponsored by Senator Corbin , and the DNA bill sponsored by Senator Bryden . 
yet , we will not receive the implementation report reviewing the way those bills are dealt with by the administration . 
when I was called to this place , when I was sworn in at the Table , and when I took this seat , I had the conviction that I would exercise exactly the same legislative authority as when I was sitting in the other place . 
this must end . 
we are regularly attacked by the opposition party in the other place and by the press who say that we are not doing our job . 
in the last two months , the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has amended two bills and approved one bill . 
we are reporting this bill with the conviction that we should follow up on the regulations , because the regulations tell more than what is contained in the bill . 
the Constitution of Canada expects us to follow up on the evaluation process in the same way as they do in the other place . 
if we do not do that , neither the government side nor the opposition side there will respect this place . 
honourable senators , in supporting this bill at third reading , we should maintain a clear perception of the status we want to maintain in the Parliament of Canada . 
this Parliament is composed of two units : the Senate and the House of Commons , equal in status , equal in privilege , equal in roles , and equal in power . 
if we do not exercise our powers , we will become obsolete . 
some Hon. Senators : 
hear , hear ! 
hon. Roch Bolduc : 
honourable senators , I would just like to point out to Senator Joyal that , in the case of the bill with respect to approval of an international treaty , I remember that we proposed an amendment and that the minister approved it . 
if we follow your logic , should we not move an amendment at third reading ? 
senator Joyal : 
honourable senators , this idea certainly occurred to senators Beaudoin , Grafstein , Bryden and Milne , and myself . 
we considered the order of reference . 
it did not concern an amendment to section 42 , which refers specifically to the authority of the Governor in Council to make regulations , but rather the addition of sections 24 and 25 . 
we felt that that would have been considered irregular . 
senator Milne did , however , make it very clear to the minister that she would intervene and follow up so that we would not find ourselves in the situation Senator Kenny described of constantly complaining but never actually taking any specific action . 
senator Bolduc : 
honourable senators , Senator Kenny maintains that letters to the minister are of dubious worth because the minister may not be there . 
that is precisely the case , and he is likely not to be there in February . 
senator Joyal : 
honourable senators , at the initiative of my colleague Senator Corbin we amended Bill C - 52 and , at the initiative of Senator Bryden , we obtained a written commitment , a firm commitment , from the Solicitor General . 
if we had done the same thing this week , however , we would have delayed implementation of the bill . 
we had a firm commitment from the minister that he would return . 
that is why we passed , without amendments , the report presented by Senator Milne and the bill . 
have no fear , Senator Bolduc , I believe that all members of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee firmly share the conviction that we must take every opportunity to reaffirm our role . 
since doing so often requires us to make amendments to bills , amend them we will . 
senator Bolduc : 
this position is inconsistent . 
we have a committee , the Standing Joint Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations , whose role is precisely to examine regulations we have not seen before . 
this makes no sense . 
hon. No ë l A . Kinsella ( Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I am not quite sure whether this last exchange has moved me from my state of uncertainty as to how I should vote on this bill , but I am now leaning toward voting against it . 
i agree with everything that Senator Joyal has said . 
the logical conclusion at which I arrive , by implication rather than inference , is that this is not a good bill . 
it is not a good piece of legislation and , therefore , we should not accept it . 
hon. Pierre Claude Nolin : 
i thought my colleagues had said everything , but the remarks by my colleague Senator Kinsella warrant my speaking . 
i share the concerns raised by all of my colleagues on committee . 
i think we must support this bill . 
we are being asked to amend clauses 24 and 25 of the bill . 
do we want to have tobacco companies promoting sports and cultural events for an unlimited time as the House agreed to a year and a half ago or do we , rather , want the practice to stop in 2003 ? 
it would be a good thing for it to stop at some point . 
i did not think so 18 months ago , but now I am convinced . 
this is not section 42 of the act we have before us . 
there were no slips 18 months ago . 
reasons that have nothing to do with the powers of this House and a lot more to do with the power of the Prime Minister to call an election , the amendments were not passed . 
that is ancient history . 
let us look to the future . 
one day we will certainly have to look at section 42 of the Tobacco Act . 
at that point , we will make sure that the appropriate amendments are made . 
i will support the bill and I encourage my colleagues to do likewise . 
hon. Lowell Murray : 
my question is for Senator Joyal . 
i accept his opinion that an amendment to section 42 would be out of order . 
it seems to me that an amendment in this regard could be made through a private bill . 
senator Joyal wants a stronger commitment from the minister . 
in the absence of such a commitment , will Senator Joyal undertake to introduce a bill in this regard ? 
senator Joyal : 
honourable senators , without any hesitation . 
i am sure that , with the support of all our colleagues , this bill would be passed faster than any other in the history of the Senate of Canada . 
the Hon. the Acting Speaker : 
honourable senators , it was moved by the Honourable Senator Mahovlich , seconded by the Honourable Senator Butts , that the bill be read the third time now . 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
some Hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
some Hon. Senators : 
on division . 
motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed , on division . 
point of Order 
hon. Marcel Prud ' homme : 
honourable senators , I rise on a point of order . 
it might not be a bad idea to add to the message to the House that this bill was passed without amendment but on division . 
in this way , they will begin to question for themselves the bills they produce in future . 
the Hon. the Acting Speaker : 
it will be noted in the Journals of the Senate that the bill was passed on division . 
canada Customs and Revenue Agency Bill 
second Reading - Debate Adjourned 
honourable senators , I am pleased to rise today to ask the support of this chamber for Bill C - 43 . 
this bill is a major piece of legislation . 
it represents , I believe , a milestone in the evolution of customs services and tax and trade administrations in Canada . 
what is proposed in Bill C - 43 is the creation of a Canada Customs and Revenue Agency . 
in short , this bill will create a single window for tax collection . 
what this means for governments , honourable senators , is reduced overlap , duplication and red tape . 
more important - and I think this is the most important aspect of this bill - it will mean a reduction in the compliance costs and paper burdens of ordinary Canadians throughout this country . 
i must tell you that the concept of this bill is not a new one . 
the delivery of tax administration through a government structure other than that of a federal department was first examined over 30 years ago by the then Royal Commission on Taxation , the Carter commission . 
the government first mentioned the idea in the February 1996 throne speech . 
it was then officially announced in the federal budget of March 1996 . 
in the budget speech , the establishment of this agency was again described as being part of the government ' s commitment to strengthening the Canadian economy and the economic union . 
these announcements were followed by consultations with the provinces and territories and with stakeholders . 
honourable senators , Revenue Canada has consulted not once , but three times , with the provinces and territories , with tax specialists , with customs specialists , and with other trade professionals and business associations on the appropriate framework , structure and organization of this new agency . 
revenue Canada has also consulted with its employees and continues to seek their input and that of their representatives . 
in April 1997 , Revenue Canada released its first progress report based on an initial round of consultations . 
as part of the second round of consultations , it established a special advisory committee to provide comments and views on the operational structure of the new agency . 
in January 1998 , Revenue Canada released a second progress report which provided additional refinements and modifications based on further consultations . 
during these consultations a wide cross - section of people and organizations from across the country offered advice and recommendations , to which the Minister of Revenue Canada responded . 
therefore , the bill now before us is a product of vast consultation . 
it has generated considerable support from all areas . 
many witnesses came forward during the committee hearings in the other place to offer their support for the concept of the agency . 
the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants , the Canadian Tax Foundation , the Canadian Bar Association , the Canadian Importers Association , the Tax Executives Institute , l ' Association de planification fiscale et financi è re , and the Canadian Federation of Independent Business . 
Mr. Robert Spindler of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants stated : 
it is clear that comments provided during the consultations were heard and taken into account . 
we ' re pleased to see that under Bill C - 43 , the Minister of Revenue will retain responsibility for this Agency and it will be structured to allow for close Ministerial oversight and , in particular , that the Minister ' s power of inquiry into any activity of the Agency will be maintained . 
i think that the bill before us is well drafted and reflects the point of view of the provinces and territories . 
it also reflects the views of stakeholders and of Revenue Canada employees . 
but , above all , it takes into account all the important issues raised by Canadians during the minister ' s three rounds of consultations . 
allow me now , honourable senators , to touch on these areas one by one to illustrate to you how I believe the bill we have before us addresses these concerns in each of these areas . 
first , what does this bill mean for the provinces and territories ? 
why have they not all signed it ? 
i must emphasize , honourable senators , that the participation of the provinces and territories in this agency is completely voluntary . 
the provinces will continue to control their provincial tax policies , while the proposed new agency will administer these policies . 
it is expected that the agency will attract increased business from the provinces once it proves it can deliver services more efficiently . 
however , I must add that three Atlantic provinces , Newfoundland , Nova Scotia and New Brunswick , asked for this agency as part of the HST agreements . 
in fact , as recently as October 13 , 1998 , Revenue Canada concluded a service contract with the Province of Nova Scotia in anticipation of this agency . 
five other provinces are working actively with Revenue Canada to determine whether the agency could improve administration of their programs and thus reduce costs . 
in addition , although none of the provinces have officially indicated their support for the agency , none , with the exception of Quebec , have rejected the idea of doing business with it . 
it should be pointed out that the agency ' s purpose is not to usurp provincial or territorial authority , but to provide a basic structure that will work for the benefit of the provinces . 
in that sense , I am confident that the agency will establish the right conditions for greater coordination of federal and provincial tax administration . 
the second issue , often discussed surrounding this bill , is cost savings . 
what are they based on ? 
how much will we save ? 
these are the common and realistic questions to ask . 
in January , 1998 , the Public Policy Forum released an important study on the costs of compliance with Canada ' s tax systems . 
they estimate that it currently costs Canadian business approximately $ 3.4 billion each year to comply with federal and provincial or territorial taxes . 
at the same time , governments spend $ 2.2 billion in administering their tax systems . 
the public policy forum estimates that with a single administration , and without the Province of Quebec on board , Canadian businesses stand to benefit by saving between $ 116 million and $ 193 million annually in compliance costs . 
governments would save between $ 37 million and $ 62 million in administrative costs . 
these are quite significant savings , honourable senators , that will be felt by Canadian taxpayers . 
the Agency ' s impact on Revenue Canada staff is another aspect of the bill that has stirred up discussion . 
it should be pointed out first of all that , from day one , all Revenue Canada employees will become agency employees . 
what is more , all indeterminate agency employees will be guaranteed two years of work . 
the new Customs and Revenue Agency will offer a certain number of advantages to Revenue Canada staff . 
it will provide faster , simpler and more transparent human resource processes . 
it will make it easier for employees to move between jobs . 
it will mean vacancies will be filled faster . 
it will result in less time waiting for promotions and transfers . 
for recourse , instead of the complex and legalistic processes that now exist , employees will have access to different options that are fair and timely and include access to an independent third party . 
honourable senators , the agency status set out in Bill C - 43 will permit a human resources framework that can be customized precisely to meet the needs of Revenue Canada employees and the clients that they serve , namely , the people of Canada . 
this bill is also about accountability and fairness . 
first , fairness is an essential foundation of the entire revenue administration . 
the commitments that Revenue Canada makes to fairness will be the commitments for the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency . 
in addition , the Minister of National Revenue launched a fairness initiative last spring with the Conference Board of Canada , to look at the fairness with which Revenue Canada presently operates . 
Canadians from all over the country were consulted . 
according to the conference board ' s independent report , Revenue Canada is well regarded among Canadians . 
honourable senators , as well as being fair , the new agency will be responsible . 
i must make it clear that full ministerial responsibility for taxation and customs legislation , as well as the general control of the agency by the government , will be maintained . 
technology is changing the way Canadians do business and also the way they do their taxes . 
there is now the option for individuals to submit their tax returns electronically , and at present 25 per cent of Canadian taxpayers choose to utilize this option . 
i would suggest to you , honourable senators , that this number will grow in the future , as more people begin to take advantage of the Internet and electronic commerce . 
however , to offer this option to the public and to carry it out costs money . 
it can require huge sums of money to develop such programs . 
if each province and territory is spending its own money to develop these options , we will have 14 different systems in Canada and , in my view , a great deal of wasted money . 
it would make more sense to develop such programs on a national basis , with one point of contact to administer and develop these new programs . 
i should like to add one further comment . 
honourable senators , when I went through my briefing with the representatives from Revenue Canada , I asked them for an absolute assurance that any responsibility given to the House of Commons for review of any aspect of this legislation would be a responsibility also given to the Senate of Canada . 
i will be the first one to move such amendment if it is not according to the way in which they have told me it is . 
hon. Roch Bolduc : 
honourable senators , I agree that Revenue Canada has some serious human resource problems that urgently need to be fixed . 
i also agree that in an ideal world , paying taxes would be a lot simpler for taxpayers and collecting them would be a lot simpler for governments . 
where I part company with the government and its approach is that I have problems both with the principle of changing Revenue Canada into an agency and with some of the details in this bill . 
the government continues to stress human resource problems as the number one justification for this agency . 
we are told that Revenue Canada ' s unique contracting and personnel needs cannot be met within the rules that apply to the entire public service . 
it takes months to hire the staff it needs , and competent people are leaving for better paid private sector jobs . 
honourable senators , Revenue Canada employs a quarter of the public service , some 40,000 people . 
it is not the only department facing personnel problems . 
if there is a problem with the government ' s biggest employer , then there is a government - wide problem that we should be fixing . 
will Statistics Canada be turned into a special operating agency because it cannot hire enough economists ? 
is the Department of Justice to become a special operating agency because it takes too long to hire lawyers ? 
will Public Works become a special operating agency to meet its need for engineers ? 
we do not need to fix Revenue Canada ; we need to fix the hiring of the Treasury Board . 
honourable senators , I should like to draw your attention to two points from last week ' s report of the Auditor General . 
the first concerns the way one branch of Revenue Canada , the International Tax Directorate , has mismanaged its staffing over the past four years . 
yes , most auditors have little experience . 
potential new hires are lost , as it takes months to fill advertised positions . 
key positions , including those of leadership , are filled by people borrowed or redeployed from elsewhere . 
the Auditor General tells us that the department has not made effective use of the tools it already has at its disposal to speed up hiring . 
why should we believe that things will be any different after the department becomes an agency ? 
the Auditor General has stressed that turning Revenue Canada into an agency will not , in itself , solve the problem . 
what is needed is a plan , as soon as possible , to hire , retain and train key employees . 
it is also interesting to note that three years after becoming a special operating agency , the Canadian Food Inspection Agency still does not have a human resources plan . 
will this agency be any different ? 
the Auditor General ' s second point concerns the general , government - wide dissatisfaction with human resource management . 
he says in his chapter on matters of special interest : 
dissatisfaction with existing human resource management is also reflected in the interest among government officials in alternative service delivery mechanisms . 
one of the driving factors has been that present staffing , classification and compensation systems are too unwieldy and inflexible . 
the government needs to ensure that the rush to get " outside the system " does not divert attention from " fixing the system . " 
honourable senators , I agree . 
instead of allowing Revenue Canada to join other departments such as the Canadian Food Inspection Agency in getting outside of the system , it is time to fix the system . 
honourable senators , the other argument we hear in support of this bill is that an agency will save money and make life easier for both governments and the taxpayer . 
revenue Canada would have us believe that governments could save between $ 97 million and $ 162 million per year if all provinces participated . 
business compliance costs could fall by between $ 171 million and $ 285 million per year , we are told . 
the provinces , very simply , are not interested . 
they do not want to lose the flexibility and control they now have . 
there is no business case for this agency because right now there are zero prospects for any sales . 
the best the government has been able to come up with to date is a minor agreement with Nova Scotia to collect Workers ' Compensation payments . 
honourable senators , can you imagine Mr. Bouchard ' s reaction when this agency starts to pitch tax collection services to local municipalities in Quebec ? 
this agency will not advance the case of national unity , believe me . 
nor is an agency necessary to collect taxes . 
Ottawa has been doing this for years for personal income taxes in nine provinces and now collects sales taxes in three . 
businesses must comply with two different criteria for what is income , what is taxable and what is deductible . 
simply dealing with one tax collector will not make life much easier unless the provinces harmonize all their sales and income tax rules with Ottawa . 
this is not on , as the provinces are not willing to surrender such power . 
even if it was on , the tax collection agreements that have been in place for years show that you do not need an agency to do this . 
if I may , honourable senators , I will raise another matter of concern to us all . 
many Canadians fear that the agency will hold too much taxpayer information in one place . 
they fear that this super - tax collector will have too much in the way of personal information , which would give it undue power over individuals , while being less accountable than a department would be to Parliament , since the minister would not be directly involved in day - to - day activities . 
we are assured that confidentiality safeguards will be integrated into the system . 
honourable senators , all the safeguards in the world will be pointless if someone with evil intent really wants to wreak havoc . 
this bill will bring to 60,000 the number of federal employees who staff special service agencies . 
the 40,000 Revenue Canada employees will be added to the 20,000 former public servants who now look after the park system , the air traffic control system and food inspection . 
honourable senators , these special operating agencies are neither departments nor Crown corporations . 
service is provided in one of three ways . 
either you are in the government sector , or you are in the private sector , but you cannot be in both . 
we are told that accountability will be retained , as the agency will report to Parliament through a minister . 
honourable senators , this is not full accountability . 
with the minister removed from day - to - day operations and decision making , we will have a minister explaining the action of others , rather than defending what he or she has done . 
within the context of accountability , I want for a minute to raise the issue of user fees . 
special operating agencies , if they cannot live within the appropriations granted by Parliament , can pad their operating budgets with user fees . 
could the day come , for example , when businesses are charged a $ 50 annual fee for the privilege of having a GST number ? 
could the day come when you are charged a $ 10 processing fee for the privilege of going through Canada Customs ? 
without proper political control and without someone to say " no , " this could become a reality , regardless of what the minister may or may not promise us in committee . 
i remind you of what Senator Kenny said about ministers ' promises . 
ministers come and go . 
honourable senators , there are other issues that need to be raised as well . 
first , one of the criticisms coming from the union is that the agency will be able to pay top level executive salaries to its senior level officials . 
if this is correct , it could help to explain why senior officials in the departments are pushing for this agency . 
could we end up with a situation a few years from now where the head of this agency makes twice as much money as the Deputy Minister of Finance who , as we know , is advising the government on economic and monetary policy ? 
the working relationship between government departments is also a matter of concern . 
today , the Deputy Minister of Finance deals with the Deputy Minister of National Revenue as an equal . 
finance makes policy ; Revenue carries it out . 
two years from now , the relationship will be that of a deputy minister dealing with a commissioner . 
traditional bureaucratic relationships will be turned upside down . 
finally , I wish to draw to the attention of the Senate the opposition of the unions that represent Revenue Canada ' s employees . 
honourable senators , if this is the key to fixing Revenue Canada ' s staffing problems , an agency is not needed to do it . 
the removal of staffing from collective agreements can be negotiated , or it can be imposed by legislation - an agency is not needed to do it . 
the bill also says that the agency must develop a program governing staffing , including the appointment of and recourse for employees . 
it does not say that the merit principle must be respected in hiring . 
it does not say that the recourse mechanism should be developed in consultation with the employees or those who represent them . 
honourable senators , I am not convinced that this bill will save money ; that it is necessary to fix Revenue Canada ' s human resources problems ; or that it will advance the cause of national unity . 
unless the government can make a convincing case in committee , my view is that this bill should be withdrawn . 
on motion of Senator Murray , debate adjourned . 
extradition Bill 
second Reading - Debate Suspended 
on the Order : 
resuming debate on the motion of the Honourable Senator Fraser , seconded by the Honourable Senator Ruck , for the second reading of Bill C - 40 , An Act respecting extradition to amend the Canada Evidence Act , the Criminal Code , the Immigration Act and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act and to amend and repeal other Acts in consequence . 
hon. G é rald - A . 
honourable senators , I should like to say a few words on Bill C - 40 , respecting extradition . 
the bill ' s sponsor , Senator Fraser , thoroughly described the content of Bill C - 40 , such that I will keep to its broad principles . 
i will also say a word about three Supreme Court decisions on extradition , namely Singh , Cotroni and Kindler . 
the primary purpose of Bill C - 40 is to modernize the law with respect to extradition by simplifying procedures and shortening delays . 
in the process , two statutes are repealed : the Extradition Act and the Fugitive Offenders Act . 
as the summary of Bill C - 40 points out , the new extradition legislation will allow for the admission into evidence of documentation contained in a certified record of the case . 
in addition , it provides that extradition will be based on the principle of dual criminality , providing that the conduct would be 
punishable both in Canada , if it had occurred in Canada , and in the jurisdiction of the extradition partner by deprivation of liberty for no less than a specified minimum period , as set out in the act or an extradition agreement . 
i note that under paragraph 44 ( 2 ) of the bill , the minister may refuse to make a surrender order if the conduct in respect of which the request for extradition is made is punishable by death under the laws that apply to the requesting state . 
in Canada , the death penalty was abolished in 1976 . 
in this respect , Canada respects the relevant provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . 
canada respects its international obligations . 
in this connection , I think it is worth repeating Mr. Justice Cory ' s remarks about the death penalty in Kindler . 
i am aware that his was a dissenting opinion , but he did not differ on this particular point . 
he wrote : 
the international community has affirmed its commitment to the principle of human dignity through the various international instruments discussed above . 
except for the United States , the western world has reinforced this commitment to human dignity , both internationally and nationally , through the express abolition of the death penalty . 
canada ' s actions in the international forum affirms its own commitment to the preservation and enhancement of human dignity and to the abolition of the death penalty . 
he also goes into the matter of the scope of section 12 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms . 
this provision protects the individual against cruel and unusual punishment . 
Mr. Justice Cory writes , in connection with section 12 and the death penalty : 
if corporal punishment , lobotomy and castration are no longer acceptable and contravene section 12 then the death penalty cannot be considered to be anything other than cruel and unusual punishment . 
it is the supreme indignity to the individual , the ultimate corporal punishment , the final and complete lobotomy and the absolute and irrevocable castration . 
as the ultimate violation of human rights , the death sentence in Canada clearly opposes the protection provided by section 12 of the Charter . 
capital punishment is cruel and unusual . 
bill C - 40 also talks of mutual legal assistance between Canada and other governments and amends the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act . 
in so doing , Bill C - 40 complies with the ratio decidendi in Cotroni . 
i recall that , in The United States v. Cotroni , the Supreme Court held , in a majority decision , that the extradition of a Canadian citizen to the United States for a crime committed in Canada but with international ramifications contravenes subsection 6 ( 1 ) of the Charter , but is justified under section 1 . 
Mr. Justice La Forest , who wrote the majority notes , felt that extradition was a prima facie violation of the right of any Canadian citizen to remain in Canada . 
he said : 
the right to remain in one ' s country is of such a character that if it is to be interfered with , such interference must be " justified " as being required to meet a reasonable state purpose . 
extradition therefore seems to be a " justified " interference , according to Mr. Justice La Forest . 
extradition seeks to satisfy urgent and real concerns : criminal proceedings , suppression of crime , protection of the public , and maintenance of peace and public order are important factors authorizing interference with paragraph 6 ( 1 ) of the Charter . 
Mr. Justice La Forest wrote : 
extradition thus shares one of the basic objectives of all criminal prosecutions : to discover the truth in respect of the charges brought against the accused in a proper hearing . 
however , Judge La Forest applied a less stringent version of the proportionality test described in Oakes . 
he explained his reasoning in the following terms : 
in the performance of the balancing task ... it seems to me , a mechanistic approach must be avoided . 
while the rights guaranteed by the Charter must be given priority in the equation , the underlying values must be sensitively weighed in a particular context against other values of a free and democratic society sought to be promoted by the legislature . 
in sensitively weighing the values guaranteed under paragraph 6 ( 1 ) of the Charter , Judge La Forest concluded that extradition constitutes a minor violation of the Charter and that it interferes with it as little as possible , while respecting the requirements of due process . 
judges Wilson and Sopinka state in their dissenting opinion that extradition of a Canadian citizen for a crime committed in Canada constitutes not a minor violation of the Charter , but on the contrary a very serious one . 
bill C - 40 will therefore allow Canada to better respect its international commitments with respect to extradition , including those relating to international criminal tribunals , and to take more effective steps against international crime . 
i would point out in passing the importance of respecting the principles of fundamental justice set out in section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . 
moreover , in Singh , the Supreme Court of Canada reaches the conclusion that subsection 71 ( 1 ) of the 1976 Immigration Act does not apply to citizens from other countries applying for refugee status . 
these aliens are entitled to a hearing by the Immigration Appeal Board , in keeping with the principles of fundamental justice . 
in this case , emphasis is placed on the fact that the word " everyone " in section 7 encompasses any person who is located in Canada . 
an alien can , therefore , invoke this section . 
i do not want to reiterate the remarks of my colleague Senator Fraser , who , as I mentioned earlier , summarized the substance of Bill C - 40 very well . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , under the provisions of rule 66 ( 3 ) , I must now terminate the discussion and ask that the bells be rung for a vote to be held at 5:30 . 
debate suspended .

Cape Breton Development Corporation 
leave having been given to revert to Senators ' Statements : 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , as promised here in the chamber earlier this week , I rise today to address the current situation of the Cape Breton Development Corporation . 
in 1990 , the federal government mandated Devco to become financially self - sufficient and gave the corporation $ 155 million over five years to meet that objective . 
in 1996 , it became apparent that the coal mining operation could not meet that objective and therefore had to request an additional $ 69 million by way of loan from the federal government in its attempt to become a commercially viable enterprise . 
despite the best efforts of the government , Devco management and the workers since that time , many obstacles still stand in the way of commercial viability . 
since September , both Devco mines , Phalan and Prince , have experienced shutdowns caused by geological and mechanical problems . 
Devco ' s board of directors recently identified an operating shortage of $ 41 million for 1998 - 99 . 
the Minister of Natural Resources Canada , the Honourable Ralph Goodale , reassures me that as a result of this new funding injection of $ 41 million , the employees need not be concerned about their salary situation for the balance of the fiscal year . 
as for the long - term future of the Crown corporation , there have been many statements in the press in recent days about privatizing Devco . 
i can assure honourable senators that no such decision has been made . 
no one has been authorized to negotiate the sale of Devco . 
there have been many discussions among my cabinet colleagues , the Province of Nova Scotia , the board of directors and Devco , and all the stakeholders as to Devco ' s future . 
i wish to state unequivocally that Mr. Minister Goodale and other cabinet colleagues are committed to finding a satisfying long - term solution to alleviate the uncertainty for the people of Cape Breton . 
hon. John Buchanan : 
honourable senators , I have a few comments to make about the minister ' s announcement . 
first , it is good news that the men will be receiving their pay , particularly before Christmas . 
i do not think there was any doubt in anyone ' s mind that that would happen . 
as far the comment that there are no plans for privatization , that is good news . 
however , what the government has not said is not good news . 
the minister knows that the problems at Phalan and Prince colliery are not over . 
he also knows that over the last few years the Nova Scotia Power Corporation has done something that it has never done before , and that is to buy American coal . 
during my time in politics in Nova Scotia , we always said that there would be no coal brought to Cape Breton from the United States or anywhere else . 
it has involved not just a few thousand tonnes but hundreds of thousands of tonnes . 
we hope that that would never happen again . 
however , if the problems , particularly Phalan , continue , then there will be more coal brought in from the United States . 
the leader referred to ending the uncertainty . 
what he said does not end the uncertainty for the miners and their families . 
there is a ratio of about three to one , so we are talking about 6,000 indirect and direct jobs in the area of Glace Bay , New Waterford and Reserve Mines in the great little town of Dominion . 
those drill ships found good , low sulphur coal in the middle . 
approximately $ 80 million was spent on two tunnels and the groundwork on the surface . 
it is still there . 
the honourable senator was with us when we went there last year . 
the problems associated with Devco will not be solved by statements such as , " The uncertainty is now ended , " because the uncertainty is not ended . 
the uncertainty will end only when the decision is made to spend money to open the new Donkin mine and assure the future of the coal industry of Cape Breton . 
we have spoken about this since 1980 , when the drill ship was brought in . 
we have spoken about it since 1985 - 86 , when the tunnels were drilled and completed . 
in the period between 1980 - in particular , between 1990 and the present - we have witnessed shut downs at Phalan , rock falls and rock bursts at Phalan , and problems at Prince colliery . 
these problems have not gone away . 
the uncertainty still exists . 
the men who work for Devco will be pleased that they will receive their pay , but it will not end the uncertainty for those 3,000 or 5,000 or 6,000 direct and indirect jobs associated with Devco . 
i know exactly where the honourable senator ' s heart lies . 
i again implore you to talk to the Government of Canada and to do the right thing by the people of Cape Breton and all of Nova Scotia . 
i know what that poll said . 
quite frankly , I have always believed that the answers you get in polls depend on the questions you ask . 
i talked to many people who were surveyed in that poll and they did not understand the question . 
they do not want to end coal mining in Cape Breton . 
the government should not be guided by a poll that says that 40 per cent of the people of Nova Scotia want to privatize Devco . 
it helped to bring me up . 
i thank you for the announcement that Devco will fund the $ 41 million and ensure that those miners get paid , but let us get down to the real business and either secure the coal industry of Cape Breton or end the uncertainty . 
those people cannot live from week to week . 
they want to know that they will have jobs next year and the year after with a new coal mine . 
in the late 1960 s and the 1970 s , the federal government developed new coal mines and closed the ones that were inefficient . 
one of those new mines was Phalen . 
we know that if Phalen goes down and Prince is left , the government will have no control over what will happen . 
coal will be brought in and natural gas will probably come in . 
let us get on with the real job . 
let us open the new Donkin mine . 
there may not be as many men working there , but at least it will secure the future . 
the Nova Scotia Power Corporation will continue to buy coal from Devco . 
let us make 1999 a good year for the coal industry of Cape Breton . 
let us end the uncertainty by doing the right thing .

child Custody and Access Reform 
consideration of Report of Committee - Debate Continued 
on the Order : 
hon. Landon Pearson : 
honourable senators , I should like to elaborate briefly on the remarks I made yesterday , when I tabled the report of the Special Joint Committee on Child Custody and Access entitled " For the Sake of the Children . " 
at the press conference after the tabling , my co - chair , Roger Gallaway , and I were asked several times what we meant by calling it a " child - centred report . " 
this question deserves an answer if our report and recommendations are to be fully understood . 
one could say , of course , that since the whole report is about child custody and access , naturally it is child - centred . 
however , as we travelled across the country we discovered that the needs and best interests of children were frequently the last thing considered by warring parents , so we tried to put children back at the centre of the issue . 
i believe that we have done so in three notable ways that will , if our recommendations are accepted , improve outcomes for children of divorce . 
first , we paid attention to child development . 
we heard from a number of knowledgeable witnesses about the importance of parenting plans being responsive to the developmental needs of children . 
we also had numerous discussions among ourselves about this . 
we know that the separation of a child ' s parents , however amicable - and I have my doubts about whether any divorce is truly amicable , although most , thank goodness , do not go on to litigation - is very stressful for that child . 
we also know that children go through various stages as they grow and develop , and that how well they navigate one stage will determine to some extent how they will manage the next one , and the next one after that , right into adulthood . 
it is very important to know what stage a child is at when his or her parents break up so that the appropriate support can be provided . 
that is why we feel so strongly that recommendation 16 , the " best interests " criteria , be included in the Divorce Act , as well as recommendation 10 , the positive benefits to be derived from " parenting after divorce " sessions , and recommendation 14 , the preparation of a parenting plan flexible enough to change as the child matures . 
as preventative measures , we strongly recommend public education programs about the impact of divorce on children in recommendation 28 ; and programs for couples wanting to avoid separation and divorce in recommendation 29 . 
in recommendation 22 , we suggest that improved professional development for judges and other relevant professionals , including information about child development , will help . 
the recommendations with respect to unified family courts are aimed at ensuring greater sensitivity to the developmental needs of children by all the people concerned . 
the second way in which the report is child - centred is in its focus on children ' s rights . 
again and again , we heard about children being tossed back and forth like so much baggage , the unhappy carriers of one parent ' s anger against the other . 
our child witnesses told us about their total sense of disempowerment . 
one 15 - year - old said : 
they are deciding your life but they don ' t even know you . 
the children want a voice in what will happen to them and we agreed that they should have it . 
article 9 deals with the right of a child to contact with both parents if separated from one . 
article 12 deals with the right of children to express their feelings freely in matters affecting them . 
the first recommendation in our report , as agreed by the whole committee , puts children ' s rights front and centre by asking that the Divorce Act be amended to include a preamble alluding to the relevant principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child . 
in recommendation 3 , we clarify the implications of the right of the child to be heard and how to ensure that it happens . 
this would include the power of the court to appoint an interested third party - an extended - family member , a public health nurse or other such person - to act as a friend of the child and to support and represent the child when he or she is experiencing difficulties during parental separation and divorce . 
in the criteria that describe the best interests of the child , in recommendation 16 , we include the views of the child where such views can reasonably be ascertained . 
in the recommendation on federal leadership , we include the idea of a children ' s commissioner to promote the interests of children at the federal level . 
all these recommendations demonstrate that the committee heard what the child witnesses told us - that if they are not given the opportunity to participate and they feel that important decisions are made without consulting them or considering their wishes , then they will have a very difficult time adapting to changed circumstances and will be doubly wounded , first , by the fact of their parents ' separation and , second , by the way in which it is done . 
children do not , however , want to be forced to make the decision themselves as to where to live or with whom . 
they want a voice , not a choice . 
respecting their rights in this matter , the committee determined , is not only their due but it will also benefit all concerned . 
the third way in which this report is child - centred is in our approach to children whose parents are engaged in highly conflicted and acrimonious divorces . 
in listening to the witnesses and reading the evidence , most of us tried to put ourselves in the places of the children who were being torn apart . 
it was very disturbing . 
most children can manage a certain amount of stress without long - term harm , but conflict without resolution puts them into a state of almost unbearable tension , particularly , but not only , if the conflict is accompanied by violence . 
just to survive emotionally , children are often forced to choose one parent over the other and to suppress that part of themselves that the other parent represents . 
that is the reason that we recommend that professionals who meet with children experiencing parental separation recognize that a child ' s wish not to have contact with a parent could reveal a significant problem and should result in an immediate referral of the family for therapeutic intervention . 
the children of highly conflicted divorces are children at great risk . 
we need to protect them . 
yet , we also need to enable them to integrate the experiences they are undergoing and reassemble the different parts of themselves so that they can mature as whole persons . 
this is why we recommend fast - tracking high - conflict divorces ; augmenting the services available at unified family courts ; enhancing the sharing of relevant information between the child protection agencies and the court ; and ensuring the availability of supervised parenting programs to serve Canadians in every part of Canada . 
at the same time , we have aimed a number of recommendations at diminishing incentives for unilateral actions , such as taking off with a child without alerting the other parent , except in an emergency , and by stating that the parent should not be permitted to rely on the resulting period of sole care and control of the child as a basis for a sole parenting order . 
other recommendations try to discourage outright child abduction across national and international borders and the use of false allegations of abuse or neglect . 
both practices are extremely harmful to children . 
violence or the threat of violence by one parent against the other , or by either or both parents against the child , is an emergency signal for society to rally round and act as a support . 
the committee recognized that we must develop a better capacity to understand the dynamics of family violence under stress if we are to avoid unintended harm to the children . 
our text speaks to the need for much greater research . 
honourable senators , when you are child - centred and a mother and grandmother , you ache to set things right . 
during our highly charged hearings in Toronto , a thoughtful witness , sensing my frustration , brought me a quotation from Samuel Johnson which I carried with me to the end of our deliberations . 
it helped me to keep my balance . 
since we in this chamber are all law - makers , I would share with you this quotation . 
it is my final comment today on this complex and difficult issue : 
how small of all that human hearts endure , That part which laws or kings can cause or cure . 
on motion of Senator DeWare , debate adjourned . 
internal Economy , Budgets and Administration 
twenty - Ninth Report of Committee Adopted 
the Senate proceeded to consideration of the twenty - ninth report of the Standing Committee on Internal Economy , Budgets and Administration ( supplementary budgets of certain Committees ) presented in the Senate on December 9 , 1998 . - ( Honourable Senator Rompkey , P . C . ) . 
hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I move that the report of the Standing Committee on Internal Economy , Budgets and Administration be adopted . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
motion agreed to and report adopted . 
human Rights 
motion to Establish Standing Committee - Motion in Amendment Adopted 
on the Order : 
resuming debate on the motion of the Honourable Senator Andreychuk , seconded by the Honourable Senator Kinsella : 
that Rule 86 ( 1 ) of the Rules of the Senate be amended by inserting immediately after paragraph ( q ) the following new paragraph ( r ) : 
" ( r ) The Senate Committee on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms , composed of twelve members , four of whom shall constitute a quorum , to which shall be referred , on order of the Senate , bills , messages , petitions , inquiries , papers and other matters relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms " . - 
( honourable Senator Andreychuk ) . 
hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , I brought this motion because of what I have heard both in this Senate chamber and without , particularly this week as we paused to note the importance to us of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms . 
there is much that I could say in this chamber but , in light of the late hour , I would simply state that there many reasons why a human rights committee is necessary within the Senate with the most important and fundamental mandate of the committee being to ensure that the work of the committee complies with our basic values on human rights . 
we would have a mechanism to ensure that we stand for all of the issues we say we stand for , by weighing our actions and words against our mandate within a human rights committee . 
it would also ensure that the basic values and fundamental freedoms we hold so dear are complied with . 
we could scrutinize many of the reports from the Human Rights Commission , from the Privacy Commissioner and other bodies within the government structure that are tasked with following human rights issues . 
we could create a forum that would allow us to air our differences and to look at where we can find common ground in good governance , the pursuit of democracy and the furtherance of human rights . 
honourable senators , I could put these points to you in long form , and I hope the arguments would be compelling . 
however , I believe all senators within this chamber have spoken on the issue of human rights at one time or another . 
other senators have written about the need for such a committee . 
therefore , I believe this motion is on behalf of all senators in an effort to narrow the distance between our words and to put our words into action . 
if we seriously believe in human rights as fundamental freedoms , this forum , which is tasked to look at national interests , regional interests and minority interests , surely should have as its top priority a human rights committee . 
we have delayed establishing a committee . 
we have said there are valid reasons for finances and for the rationalization of such a committee . 
honourable senators , I do not believe the issue of human rights can wait any longer . 
if we continue to have special committees empanelled , if we continue to have standing committees , and if we believe human rights is a fundamental issue , we should not delay any further . 
let us constitute a human rights committee . 
hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , at the present time the Rules Committee is debating , discussing and deliberating on the entire structure of the committee system . 
one of the issues to come up , time and time again , through various proposals submitted to the Rules Committee has been the formulation and development of a new committee called the Human Rights Committee . 
i think there is a great deal of interest in the establishment of this committee on both sides of the chamber . 
however , I do not think it would be appropriate for us , as the Senate , to take away from the power of the Rules Committee . 
it is important for the Rules Committee to not only examine this committee in all of its strength of purpose , which I think it has , but also within the context of the entire review , which has been ongoing now for some months and which I hope will be brought to fruition in February when we return . 
motion in Amendment 
hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I move , seconded by the Honourable Senator Joyal : 
that the motion be not now adopted , but that it be referred to the Standing Committee on Privileges , Standing Rules and Orders for consideration and report . 
hon. Joyce Fairbairn ( The Hon. the Acting Speaker ) : 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion in amendment ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
motion in amendment agreed to .

that the Senate congratulate the Government of Ontario for providing financial assistance to all those who contracted Hepatitis C , regardless of when the infection occurred . - ( 
honourable Senator Carstairs ) . 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I wish to say a few words on this particular motion . 
the motion before us calls for the Senate , a federal parliamentary body with a tradition of being sensitive to regional concerns , to congratulate the Province of Ontario for doing something that every other province has refused to do . 
however , from the remaining provinces , there have been no messages of congratulations to Ontario . 
this is not because a particular political party happens to form the government of those provinces . 
the Conservative Government of Prince Edward Island has refrained from sending Premier Harris a message of congratulations . 
conservative Premier Filmon of Manitoba and Conservative Premier Klein of Alberta have not tabled motions in their respective legislatures along the lines proposed by my honourable friend the Leader of the Opposition . 
the NDP Romanow Government of Saskatchewan and the NDP Clark Government of British Columbia , likewise , have not sent letters of congratulations to Premier Harris . 
i begin my remarks in this way in order to place the motion into a wider national context . 
i think it is important to recognize that this motion is asking that we congratulate a provincial government for taking a position that is not supported by the vast majority of other provinces and regions of the country . 
to adopt such a motion would be most unusual for a chamber that prides itself on being sensitive to the views of the provinces and the regions . 
perhaps the answer is that the issue itself is so critical and that the actions of the federal government and other provinces have been so reprehensible that such a resolution by this chamber is called for . 
however , when one examines the facts , I do not believe that such a conclusion is warranted . 
first , let us be clear that we are all in agreement that the plight of those infected with hepatitis C through the blood system is a painful and tragic one ; but let us also be clear that it is a matter that rests within the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces . 
unfortunately , even as the dimensions of the problem became apparent , the provinces refused to respond . 
it is no secret that one of the most vigorous opponents of any compensation scheme was the current government of the Province of Ontario . 
minister Rock , as the Minister of Health for the entire country , thought that this was a very unfair outcome , and he initiated a dialogue with the provinces . 
after long months of cajoling and arguing , unanimous agreement was reached to offer compensation to those infected between 1986 and 1990 , when it would have been possible to screen the blood supply had scientifically recognized tests been used . 
all provinces were in agreement with the proposal . 
the federal government committed $ 800 million , while the provinces committed $ 300 million . 
however , in response to public and political pressure , Ontario and Quebec called for the agreement to be reopened . 
the other provinces , apart from British Columbia which stayed on the fence , disagreed . 
they wanted the agreement to remain intact . 
in June of this year , the Senate passed a motion that , in its second paragraph , called upon , and I quote : 
... the Government of Canada and the Governments of the Provinces and Territories to take positive action to address the needs of those who suffer ill - effects from hepatitis C contracted through the blood system ; 
on September 18 of this year , Minister Rock presented to his provincial colleagues , on behalf of the federal government , a comprehensive proposal to address the needs of all Canadians who have been infected with hepatitis C through the blood system . 
the proposal , with a value of up to $ 825 million , consists of four main elements . 
first , the federal government would pay one - half of the estimated $ 600 million required to ensure that all those who contracted hepatitis C through the blood system have long - term access to medical services beyond those which would be available to hepatitis C sufferers through their provincial health insurance programs . 
honourable senators , this would provide drugs and medical services , such as nursing care at home . 
these people were infected through the blood system . 
they should not have to bear the expenses of medical treatment that is not covered by their provincial health plans . 
the second element of the proposal made by Minister Rock is that the federal government will also pay one - half of the cost of provincial and territorial look - back , trace - back initiatives . 
that is up to $ 50 million . 
these initiatives are a crucial step in helping to identify people infected through the blood system and those who have donated infected blood . 
many of these people are not aware that they are infected and , thus , are not being treated . 
third , the federal government will devote $ 125 million in new resources to strengthen Canada ' s blood regulation and disease surveillance capacity so that the risk of future blood tragedies is minimized . 
these changes will implement the recommendations made by the Krever commission . 
as we all know , the final report of the Krever commission told Canadians a very detailed story about how the blood system in Canada has operated over the past several decades . 
it recommended extensive structural reform to improve both risk management and operational aspects of the blood system . 
as the fourth element of the proposal , the federal government will also devote $ 50 million for medical research , physician education and community - based support programs for those with hepatitis C . The Medical Research Council will coordinate the efforts to find new treatments and , we hope , an eventual cure for the hepatitis C virus . 
honourable senators , in summary , the federal government ' s package , together with the $ 800 million already pledged , brings the total federal commitment to $ 1.3 billion . 
the specific offer made to the provinces on services is a fair response to those who received hepatitis C through the blood system outside the period from 1986 to 1990 . 
it is an appropriate response to hepatitis C , as it is a disease requiring treatment , not payment and care , not cash . 
the federal government believes that the offer respecting services to the provinces will meet Canadian ' s test of fairness and compassion . 
the issue , honourable senators , is not , and never has been , simply about providing people with cash ; it is about providing fellow Canadians , who are in need , with help . 
the federal government believes the proposal does just that . 
the federal government has been negotiating with the provinces and territories to try to solve this difficult issue of those individuals infected through the blood system before 1986 and after 1990 . 
the federal government has made a proposal . 
we have confidence that the provinces will put politics aside and join the federal government in helping out fellow Canadians who are in need . 
let us wish the ministers of health from both the federal and provincial - territorial governments well in their ongoing efforts to deal with this very difficult issue . 
in the meantime , I do not believe it would be helpful to those ongoing efforts if this chamber passed the motion proposed by my honourable friend the Leader of the Opposition , particularly since it would fail to recognize the very divergent position that has been taken by the vast majority of provinces which we , as senators , reside in and represent . 
hon. John Lynch - Staunton ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I am surprised , not to say shocked , that the Leader of the Government has conveniently forgotten that he joined , with all members of this chamber , on June 18 - 
the Hon. the Acting Speaker : 
honourable senators , I draw to the attention of honourable senators the fact that , if Senator Lynch - Staunton speaks now , he will be closing the debate . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
on June 18 , Senator Graham joined with all the members of this chamber in support of a motion in amendment made by Senator Kirby , which reads that this chamber supports : 
- recommendation 1 of the Commission of Inquiry on the Blood System in Canada which calls upon provinces and territories to respond to the needs of those who suffered due to the management of the blood supply system ; 
this chamber on June 18 , on the recommendation of the government side , amended a motion made on this side to support compensation to all victims of tainted blood or tainted blood products . 
to ensure that we knew exactly to what we were committing ourselves in supporting recommendation 1 , Senator Carstairs said : 
honourable senators , the purpose of the original amendment , I believe , and that of the motion proposed by the Honourable Senator Lynch - Staunton , was to support the report of the Krever inquiry . 
the motion supports that recommendation , in other words . 
therefore , both Senator Kirby and the deputy leader confirmed that the motion in amendment supported recommendation 1 of the Krever inquiry , which urged all provinces and territories to devise a compensation package for which all victims , not just those within a stated period of years , of tainted blood and blood products be eligible . 
the Province of Ontario announced in May that it would devise such a compensation package , and last month it gave the details of it . 
i think it is only normal that we pride ourselves in taking some credit - whether deserved or not , I think we can - because a copy of our motion was sent to all Ministers of Health in the provinces and territories , as well as to the federal Minister of Health . 
we should take some satisfaction , if not pride , in the knowledge that at least one province , and the largest one at that , has agreed with our motion and has followed its recommendation . 
the least we can do is congratulate that province and hope , though it is not written in the motion , that other provinces will follow suit . 
if honourable senators decide not to support this motion , they will be , in effect , contradicting the position they took in June . 
this motion is a natural outcome of the position we took on June 18 . 
it has nothing to do with the position of the provinces regarding the compensation package - who is in favour and who is not , who is sending motions of congratulations and who is not . 
it is asking the chamber to congratulate a province which took the lead in devising a package applicable to all and confirming a position which was taken in this chamber . 
a vote against this motion is a vote against the position taken in June . 
putting ourselves in such a contradictory position will be very difficult to explain . 
the Hon. the Acting Speaker : 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
some Hon. Senators : 
Yes. 
some Hon. Senators : 
No. 
the Hon. the Acting Speaker : 
will those honourable senators in favour of the motion please say " yea . " 
some Hon. Senators : 
yea . 
the Hon. the Acting Speaker : 
will those honourable senators opposed to the motion please say " nay . " 
some Hon. Senators : 
nay . 
the Hon. the Acting Speaker : 
in my opinion , the " nays " have it . 
and two honourable senators having risen . 
the Hon. the Acting Speaker : 
call in the senators . 
we will have a 10 - minute bell , which means the vote will take place at 7:05 p.m. 
motion negatived on the following division :

universal Declaration of Human Rights 
commemoration of Fiftieth Anniversary - Inquiry - Debate Continued 
on the Order : 
resuming debate on the inquiry of the Honourable Senator Wilson calling the attention of the Senate to the fiftieth anniversary year of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights , and its implications for Canada . - 
( honourable Senator Roche ) . 
hon. No ë l A . Kinsella ( Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , the inquiry Senator Wilson has on the Order Paper calls our attention to the 50 th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its implication for Canada . 
as we heard during Senators ' Statement earlier today , today we mark the 50 th anniversary , to the day , of the proclamation of the universal declaration by the General Assembly of the United Nations in Paris . 
we have on our record many important historical notes and much analysis on the universal declaration to which all honourable senators have contributed in our various debates and statements in this chamber . 
i wish not to repeat those but to draw our attention to the fact that , whilst the Canadian record in the area of human rights is not too bad , that does not mean there is not room for improvement . 
we know that until a couple of days before the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 , it was not certain that Canada would sign it . 
fortunately , the problems that were perceived at the time were overcome , and Canada did sign the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . 
on the eve of 1999 , indeed , on the eve of the millennium , it is important to draw attention to the fact that the universal declaration contains not only an outline of many civil and political rights or classical freedoms - such as the right to life and liberty - but recognizes and articulates a large array of economic , social and cultural rights . 
article 26 recognizes the right to education . 
honourable senators , I believe that economic , social and cultural rights will be the area of human rights that will attract our attention over the next few years in a very concerted fashion . 
canada ' s report under the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights was examined by the committee which serves as the social auditor for the compliance of state parties such as Canada under that covenant . 
on December 4 , 1998 , that committee released its concluding observations on the level of compliance by Canada to the economic , social and cultural rights which are our treaty obligations under that covenant . 
in that report , the human rights committee points out a number of positive aspects of Canada ' s report of compliance . 
the committee notes , for example , that , for the last five years , Canada has been ranked at the top of the United Nations ' Development Program ' s human development index . 
the HDI indicates that , on average , Canadians enjoy a singularly high standard of living and that Canada has the capacity , therefore , to achieve a high level of respect for all of these social , economic and cultural rights obligations . 
that this , however , has not yet been achieved is reflected in the fact that the UNDP ' s human poverty index ranks Canada tenth on the list for industrialized countries . 
the committee further stated that , whilst they welcome the Canadian Human Rights Commission ' s statement that the protection and enjoyment of economic and social rights in Canada is something that our federal Human Rights Commission monitors , they were concerned with the observation by our Human Rights Commission to the effect that the protection and enjoyment of economic and social rights in Canada is inadequate . 
it also welcomes its proposal for the inclusion of those rights in the human rights legislation which had been recommended by our Human Rights Commission as long ago as 1993 . 
the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations notes that , since 1994 , in addressing the budget deficits by slashing social expenditure , Canada has not paid sufficient attention to the adverse consequences for the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights by the Canadian population as a whole , and by vulnerable groups in particular . 
honourable senators , the committee observes as well that it is gravely concerned that such a wealthy country as Canada has allowed the problem of homelessness and inadequate housing to grow to such proportions that the mayors of Canada ' s ten largest cities have now declared homelessness a national disaster . 
the committee also states in its report issued last Friday that they are concerned that loan programs for post - secondary education are available only to Canadian citizens and permanent residents and that recognized refugees who do not have permanent resident status , as well as asylum seekers , are ineligible for these programs . 
the committee also views with concern the fact that tuition fees for university education in Canada have dramatically increased in the past years , making it very difficult for those in need to attend university in the absence of a loan or grant . 
a further subject of concern is the significant increase in the average student debt on graduation . 
they say that programs for people who have been discharged from psychiatric institutions appear to be entirely inadequate . 
although the government failed to provide to the committee any information regarding homelessness among discharged psychiatric patients , the committee was told that a large number of those patients end up on the street while others suffer from inadequate housing with insufficient support services . 
honourable senators , the committee again urges federal , provincial and territorial governments to expand protection in human rights legislation to include social and economic rights , and to protect poor people in all jurisdictions from discrimination because of social or economic status . 
honourable senators , the UN Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights has simply done a social audit that looked at a report prepared by Canada , a preparation that involved not only the Government of Canada but also the governments of each of the provinces and the territories . 
it was submitted to this committee in Geneva . 
the committee examined it and posed a series of 81 supplementary questions . 
there was some difficulty , as honourable senators have learned from Senator Andreychuk , in having Canada appear quickly before the committee . 
finally , when we did appear a few weeks ago , led by a Canadian ambassador , we were in for a very serious grilling . 
we have been found wanting . 
in earlier times , I had the opportunity to mark examinations at this time of the year . 
i am afraid that our report got only a D , which is barely a passing grade . 
our challenge , honourable senators , in the field of human rights during this period when we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the universal declaration , is to give greater focus to the economic , social , and cultural rights outlined in that declaration . 
much more work and progress needs to be made in that area . 
that is the challenge that faces Canada , in my view , in the human rights agenda over the coming years . 
for me , that is the implication for Canada with regard to the universal declaration , to which Senator Wilson drew our attention . 
hon. John B . Stewart : 
would the Honourable Senator Kinsella accept a question ? 
senator Kinsella : 
Yes. 
senator Stewart : 
the honourable senator has told us , based on the report of the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations , how badly we have done in fulfilling our undertakings under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . 
he has detailed those things which we ought to have done and which we have not done . 
i understand his challenge , and I do not disagree with what he said on that . 
my question relates to our international relations . 
let us assume that we all agree that what Senator Kinsella has said about our sins of omission is correct . 
does that not mean that we lack a secure basis from which to criticize our trading partners , especially in Asia ? 
how can we , with a straight face , talk to some of these countries when our own performance is so dismal ? 
senator Kinsella : 
i thank the honourable senator for the excellent question . 
it underscores the importance that we in Canada , particularly in Parliament , must give to our domestic human rights record . 
this report from which I have been reading was a report prepared by those outside of Canada who examined a report prepared by those of us inside Canada against the norm which grew out of the universal declaration , the norm being the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , which Canada ratified in 1976 with the written approval of every jurisdiction in Canada . 
we all agreed to accept this norm of economic , social and cultural rights . 
my view is that under the civil and political rights covenant , we have a very enviable record . 
our record is not so good as judged by the social auditor in the area of economic , social and cultural rights . 
in specific answer to Senator Stewart ' s question , I should think that people to whom we are attempting to provide assistance in the area of democratization and civism to improve their domestic systems of human rights would look with jaundiced eyes - or questioning eyes , at least - at a situation which the committee in Geneva drew to our attention , and which was admitted to by our ambassador and the officials appearing before the committee - the fact that almost one - quarter of aboriginal household dwellings in Canada require major repairs for lack of basic amenities . 
the committee pointed out that there are thousands of households in Canada without running water and indoor toilets . 
they cannot understand how a country as wealthy and as blessed as Canada would not have its social priorities in order and would be faced with that kind of violation or , quite frankly , failure to meet the obligation of housing rights provided for in the covenant . 
for our interlocutors in other countries around the world , economic , social and cultural rights are human rights just like civil and political rights . 
there is a unity to human rights . 
it is just that in the area of promotion and the fullness of the realization of the rights and the enjoyment of the rights , economic , social and cultural rights are more programatic by nature and require ongoing programs of the state . 
when the committee looked at some of the areas , such as post - secondary education , which Article 13 provides should become progressively freer , they saw that the opposite was the case . 
countries that accept the universal declaration as a statement of a complete universal standard and that there is unity and integrity to all of the rights must raise their eyebrows in question . 
therefore , it seems to me that it is important for Canada to give focus to greater delivery in the areas of economic , cultural and social rights to our own people , if we wish to have credibility with those with whom we interact . 
senator Stewart : 
i thank the honourable senator for that response . 
however , he continues to emphasize our own sins of omission . 
of course he encourages us to do much better . 
my question is quite practical . 
how do we avoid the practical problem of appearing to be hypocrites ? 
senator Kinsella : 
honourable senators , the fact of the matter is that our credibility will be enriched if we take seriously the recommendations that have been made under this mechanism and take the necessary steps . 
senator Stewart : 
i understand that . 
senator Kinsella : 
if we fail to take those steps , we will be judged to be hypocritical , and perhaps rightly so . 
senator Stewart : 
until those steps have produced results , is it your argument that we should keep our mouths shut ? 
senator Kinsella : 
absolutely not . 
the promotion and the protection of human rights is an obligation which falls on all our shoulders . 
it is an obligation that falls on our shoulders because of the solidarity of all the peoples of the world . 
it would not be acceptable for us to be silent . 
the judgments that we make , I do not believe , are judgments in the order of morality nor in the order of , " We are better than you . " 
this norm is universal . 
this is not a Canadian norm . 
we are participating in a universal struggle for the promotion of human rights just as we participated in the promotion of the worldwide movement to eradicate racism in all its forms , including apartheid . 
we did so notwithstanding the fact that there are many cases of racism in Canada , to wit the reports of the Human Rights Commission that deal with them . 
rather than us adopting a position of silence , we want Canada to be more vigorous and to recognize that we can learn from other communities . 
in the dialogue and the discourse on human rights , it is important for Canada to be fully engaged . 
on motion of Senator Carstairs , debate adjourned . 
history of the Chinese in Canada 
notice of Inquiry - Order Stands 
leave having been given to revert to Notice of Inquiries : 
hon. Vivienne Poy : 
honourable senators , I give notice that my inquiry on the history of the Chinese in Canada will commence on February 2 , as opposed to February 9 . 
the Hon. the Acting Speaker : 
honourable senators , is it agreed ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
child Custody and Access Reform 
consideration of Report of Committee - Debate Continued 
on the Order : 
resuming debate on the consideration of the final report of the Special Joint Committee on Child Custody and Access entitled : " For the Sake of the Children " , tabled in the Senate on December 9 , 1998 . - ( Honourable Senator Pearson ) . 
hon. Anne C . Cools : 
honourable senators , as always I feel indebted to honourable senators . 
i rise to speak to this committee ' s report , " For the Sake of the Children . " 
the tears of this nation that have been shed over the children of divorce are a river . 
the tears of the children of divorce may flow well into their adulthood as many are robbed of their childhood . 
Canadians have wept , like Jacob ' s wife , Rachael , for the children of divorce . 
honourable senators , their suffering is our suffering . 
honourable senators , these issues have been my work throughout my adult life . 
i recall my maiden speech here in this chamber made in response to the Throne Speech of the newly elected Conservative government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney . 
that day , December 4 , 1984 , I spoke about divorce and families . 
i said : 
in the section on social justice , the government makes a great commitment to women . 
i plead and pray that this commitment to women is real and not part and parcel of the rather hysterical , cosmetic , so - called " justice for women " which seems to be running rampant these days , particularly in the newspapers . 
this woman is one who believes she can have her personhood without robbing other human beings of their personhood . 
i hope the commitment in the Throne Speech is to a genuine and real womanhood . 
about divorce and the government ` s then intention to bring a bill , I continued : 
i intend to work towards ensuring that the new legislation will include , or at least that an attempt will be made to have it include the new concept of shared parenting , joint custody , so that one spouse is not isolated from parenting at the wish and whim of the other . 
i hope the new legislation will reduce the deleterious effects on children of these marital disputes . 
the speech mentions enforcement of maintenance orders , but it does not mention an amendment to the Income Tax Act so that perhaps spouses who are paying support for children over 18 years may be permitted to pay the children directly rather than making payments to the spouse , so that those paying spouses can glean some sort of shelter under the Income Tax Act . 
i repeat , in 1984 , I proposed and supported shared parenting . 
honourable senators , in 1996 and 1997 , during Senate debate here on Bill C - 41 amending the Divorce Act to implement the federal child support guidelines , I drew a line in the sand . 
i asserted that the children of divorce deserve the financial , emotional and psychological support of both their parents . 
i have asserted repeatedly that children of divorce deserve the love and support of both their parents , both mother and father , and that it is the duty of Parliament to vindicate the need of the children of divorce for both their parents . 
honourable senators , my point of view is well supported by the public . 
the pollster , Dr. Conrad Winn is quoted as stating that : 
i can ' t find an adjective to describe the intensity of public dismay over family issues and the unfulfilled rights of fathers and children ... 
i ' m surprised because these issues haven ' t been on the agenda of Canadian politics for a very long time . 
the most astonishing thing is the absolute consensus among men and women about how the rights and obligations of fathers and children are being ignored . 
that same poll told us that , of the respondents , 70 per cent of Canadians believe that children of divorce receive too little attention and 62 per cent said that fathers receive too little attention . 
eighty per cent of those surveyed felt it was very important for children of divorced parents to maintain an ongoing relationship with the non - custodial parent . 
these poll results show very clearly that Canadian public opinion is in tune with the finest of this joint committee ' s recommendations , which are the recommendations for shared parenting . 
Canadians care , and care passionately , about the children of divorce . 
honourable senators , this committee ' s recommendations 5 to 9 are dramatic ; they recommend a major shift in the divorce law and the divorce culture of Canada . 
they recommend shared parenting as a legal and statutory concept . 
recommendation 5 reads : 
this Committee recommends that the terms " custody and access " no longer be used in the Divorce Act and instead that the meaning of both terms be incorporated and received in the new term " shared parenting , " which shall be taken to include all the meanings , rights , obligations , and common - law and statutory interpretations embodied previously in the terms " custody and access . " 
this means a transfer of the legal meaning and power of the terms " custody and access " to the term " shared parenting . " 
recommendation 6 reads : 
this Committee recommends that the Divorce Act be amended to repeal the definition of " custody " and to add a definition of " shared parenting " that reflects the meaning ascribed to that term by this Committee . 
recommendation 8 reads : 
this Committee recommends that the common law " tender years doctrine " be rejected as a guide to decision making about parenting . 
finally , recommendation 9 reads : 
this Committee recommends that both parents of a child receive information and records in respect of the child ' s development and social activities , such as school records , medical records and other relevant information . 
the obligation to provided such information should extend to schools , doctors , hospitals and others generating such information or records , as well as to both parents , unless ordered otherwise by a court . 
honourable senators , this recommendation says very clearly that no parent of a child is to be denied information by any school principal about a child , and that the principal must not be put in a difficult position . 
both parents will have an entitlement in law to that sort of information about their child . 
honourable senators , it is very important that we understand this , because last year when we fought here on Bill C - 41 , we fought because the federal Divorce Act is one of the few places in federal legislation that ever ascribed any entitlement to children . 
most children ' s issues are dealt with provincially . 
one of the reasons I objected so strongly last year was that I saw that the repeal of a particular section was the removal of an historical right of children , which was recorded and articulated in the Divorce Act . 
the only other place in federal legislation that the rights of children were articulated was the Juvenile Delinquents Act . 
i have said in this chamber before that Sir Wilfrid Laurier had been inching his way to bring the issues around children into federal purview , and that had motivated the Juvenile Delinquents Act in 1908 . 
honourable senators , these recommendations propose a new Divorce Act which will vindicate , in statute , the entitlement of children to their two parents so as to bring forward a modern , contemporary and balanced law to meet the year 2000 . 
two parents by the year 2000 is my new motto . 
you could call it " two by two . " 
honourable senators , this committee for me , personally , has been the " committee from hell . " 
i borrow that metaphor from Toronto author Wendy Dennis ' s just published book , The Divorce from Hell . 
she wrote about the divorce inferno that has consumed so many families emotionally and financially . 
i describe it as the " committee from hell " because of the persistent derision and maligning directed towards me from certain quarters , aggression which has only added to my character and strengthened my resolve to bring some light to this darkness , as some children of divorce , sometimes described by me as the children of Sisyphus , are held hostage to conflict , even hatred , while the courts and Parliament have seen fit to do little or nothing to correct the obvious injustice and the anguish of so many . 
this silence is indicative of our human paucity , the paucity and imperfection of human nature , and the paucity of the human condition . 
that , honourable senators , is a grand mystery of life , which is only understood in the long run by having a spiritual set of beliefs . 
honourable senators , I have travelled the width and breadth of this country on these issues . 
i have spoken to thousands of Canadians in person and to millions in media interviews . 
the public mind of this land and the public heart have spoken . 
in fact , the public will of this land has overtaken the committee ' s report . 
the report of the committee has been overtaken by the developments in the public mind and the public realm . 
the public of this land wants the Minister of Justice , Anne McLellan , to act speedily , without delay , to bring a new Divorce Act to reflect contemporary Canadian values of fairness , balance and equality for children , parents and families in divorce . 
Canadians want our government to adopt aggressive policies and values on family and family life . 
change is necessary . 
honourable senators , you would have to know my family and how I grew up , but I was raised to believe that one person can make a difference . 
i hope that I have made a difference . 
i have certainly tried very hard to do so . 
honourable senators , I would like to close by quoting Psalm 127 , verse 3 : 
children are a gift from the LORD ; They are a real blessing . 
honourable senators , I sincerely believe this . 
as persons , as individuals and as parliamentarians , and on behalf of the Sovereign , the Supreme Parent , the parens patriae , we are the stewards of the children of this land . 
honourable senators , the name of this report is " For the Sake of the Children . " 
had I had the opportunity to choose the name of this report , I would have chosen the title " Children of the Spring . " 
i thank you , honourable senators , for your attention . 
on motion of Senator Kinsella , for Senator DeWare , debate adjourned . 
canada - Europe Parliamentary Association 
council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly Held in Strasbourg , France - Inquiry - Debate Adjourned 
hon. Lorna Milne rose pursuant to notice of December 1 , 1998 : 
that she will call the attention of the Senate to the journey of the Canada - Europe Parliamentary Association delegation to the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly , in Strasbourg , France . 
six Canadian parliamentarians were there as official observers , led by the chair of the Canada - Europe Association , member of Parliament Charles Caccia . 
the other members of the delegation were Senator Roch Bolduc , members of Parliament Raymonde Folco , Francine Lalonde and Gary Lunn . 
we were joined in Strasbourg by John Noble , our new ambassador to Switzerland , who also acts as Canada ' s permanent observer with the Council of Europe , and by Anthony Burger from the Canadian Commission to the OECD . 
at the assembly , we Canadians were able to participate fully in the debates because of our new status as official observers . 
the discussions focused on many different areas , including relations with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ; Fisheries Policies and the State of the Oceans ; and the European Union ' s proposed Code of Conduct on Arms Sales . 
at the request of members of the European Union , I spoke to Canada ' s strong support of this initiative , but of our concerns that stronger and enforceable action in some legally binding form , such as a treaty , would ultimately be needed . 
senator Bolduc also spoke to the Enlarged Assembly on this subject . 
the final version of the resolution adopted by the assembly on September 23 had a great deal of Canadian input . 
throughout the entire week , many references were made to the terrible situation in Kosovo . 
at that time they figured that at least 150,000 people were seeking refuge and fleeing over the borders into the rest of Europe , looking for safety . 
most of those sheltering in the forests have no homes to which they can return . 
to add to the suffering , the harvest has been totally destroyed . 
all members of our delegation spoke during the assembly debates , with our total of nine interventions being the most ever by Canadian parliamentarians in a Council of Europe session . 
Strasbourg itself is a beautiful city that was founded by the Romans in 12 BC on the West Bank of the Rhine in the Alsace area of France . 
it was built around an extensive river and canal system . 
the oldest area of the city , la Petite France , was just a few blocks away from our hotel . 
i spent as much spare time as I had , which was very little , wandering around the cobbled streets and around and through and over the old mills and mill dams that are built there on a series of small islands . 
the area has been well restored and rebuilt after centuries of wartime destruction and is full of 500 - and 600 - year - old half - timbered buildings that hang out over the narrow cobblestoned streets . 
the great rose window was completed in about 1340 , and the spire , the tallest structure in Western Christendom for over 400 years , was added from 1419 to 1435 . 
the cathedral still has much of its original medieval stained glass windows surviving , which is very unusual in this area that has been fought over so many times . 
apparently , they were protected during both world wars by the citizens of the area who removed and hid them . 
while this was a wonderful educational experience , I must say that we worked very hard while I was there , as Senator Bolduc can testify . 
we attended the various debates all day long , broken only by a short trip to a cafeteria for lunch . 
after the day ' s sessions ended at about seven o ' clock each evening , we would attend an evening function which was usually an extension of our diplomatic efforts and contacts . 
an example of one such evening was hosted by Madam Helle Degn of Denmark , the chair of the Committee on Economic Affairs and Development , to thank those delegates who had worked so hard on the amendments that her committee had presented . 
it was a pleasure to meet Madam Degn again just a week later here in Canada when she led a return delegation of European parliamentarians to discuss and learn from our Canadian experience with NAFTA . 
in conclusion , as this oldest European body devoted to the aims of democratic and social cohesion and the advancement of human rights approaches its fiftieth anniversary in 1999 , the benefits to Canada of holding observer status are becoming apparent , particularly as more Canadian voices are being heard within this privileged forum of 40 countries . 
it was encouraging to see how Canada is not only listened to with respect but actively invited by the Europeans to make interventions on subjects under discussion . 
it is a valuable forum for us to take a leading role in bridging what has recently been described as a widening gap between Europe and the U.S.A. , as they both seem to be trending toward increasing self - interest and protectionism . 
on motion of Senator Prud ' homme , debate adjourned . 
state of Financial System 
motion to Authorize Banking , Trade and Commerce Committee to Extend Date of Final Report on Study Amended 
hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) for Senator Kirby , pursuant to notice of December 9 , 1998 , moved : 
that , notwithstanding the order of reference adopted by the Senate on Wednesday , October 22 , 1997 , the Standing Senate Committee on Banking , Trade and Commerce be authorised to extend the date for the presentation of its final report on the state of the financial system in Canada from December 10 , 1998 to December 10 , 1999 ; and 
that , notwithstanding usual practices , if the Senate is not sitting when the report is completed , the Committee be authorised to deposit it with the Clerk of the Senate , and that the said report shall thereupon be deemed to have been tabled in the Chamber . 
hon. No ë l A . Kinsella , ( Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , could we have an explanation as to why this committee needs an extension of an entire year in which to present its final report ? 
senator Carstairs : 
honourable senators , I cannot give you that explanation , although I do know that the committee is engaged in an ongoing study . 
why they are asking for an extension of one full year , I do not know . 
senator Kinsella : 
it seems to me that if he cannot be bothered to be here to explain his motion to us , we are left with no alternative but to take the adjournment of the debate until we find out why . 
perhaps we can come back to it before we adjourn today if the honourable senator can get some information . 
hon. John B . Stewart : 
senator Tkachuk could explain it . 
he is the deputy chair . 
senator Kinsella : 
he is not here . 
the whole club is gone . 
senator Carstairs : 
honourable senators , if it is agreeable with honourable senators , perhaps I could change the date in this motion to February 28 . 
then , when we return , someone from the Banking Committee could perhaps explain it . 
that would mean they were not in violation of the Senate . 
if we do not give them permission as of today , they will be in violation of their necessity to report . 
therefore , it might be helpful if we could change the date from December 10 , 1999 to February 28 , 1999 , and then they could come back and explain why they need a further extension , and we will leave it with them . 
senator Kinsella : 
that is a good suggestion . 
hon. Marcel Prud ' homme : 
i second that . 
the Hon. the Acting Speaker : 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion as amended ? 
some Hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
hon. John Lynch - Staunton ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , it is agreed on the understanding that when extensions or any special permissions are requested by the chairman , if the chairman cannot be here for whatever valid reason , then at least a member of the committee will be here to give an explanation and not put the burden on the deputy leader who obviously cannot give all the answers requested . 
i think it is unfair to her and somewhat cavalier towards the Senate . 
they must have a reason as to why this motion was only made on December 9 when the report was due on December 10 and they are asking for a 12 - month extension . 
i think someone should have been here to explain . 
i agree to give them until the end of February but they had better provide a valid explanation if they want an extension until the end of next year . 
the Hon. the Acting Speaker : 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion as amended ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
motion as amended agreed to . 
business of the Senate 
the Hon. the Acting Speaker : 
honourable senators , that is the end of our business for the day .

the Senate adjourned during pleasure .

Christmas Greetings 
hon. No ë l A . Kinsella ( Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I rise to take this opportunity , on behalf of my colleagues on this side of the house , to salute the Table officers of this place and to extend our gratitude to them for their wise counsel and efficient guidance , procedurally and otherwise , that they rendered to us during 1998 . 
i should also like to mention the pages and the excellent program that His Honour oversees in bringing pages to this chamber , under the exchange program with the other House . 
my colleagues wish to extend every good wish to them and to their families . 
for those who travel home from university during the Christmas break , we hope that you do so with care , and we look forward to seeing you back here in 1999 . 
to the parliamentary reporters , who record with accuracy and care all the utterances that are made in this place , we extend to you and your families every good wish for the season of Christmas holidays and the New Year . 
to the translators , who are mindful ever of the great Latin dictum that means that the translators must not be traitors , we thank you , and we apologize to you for the times when we speak rather rapidly here in the heat of debate and make your job of translating simultaneously that much more of a challenge . 
i send hearty good wishes to our security staff who have looked after us this year . 
we leave this place after another year with all parts roughly associated with the places where the design of our person indicated they should be . 
we thank you . 
on behalf of my colleagues in the opposition , we salute them and wish them every blessing of Christmas and every good wish for the New Year . 
hon. Senators : 
hear , hear ! 
hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , it is always a special moment at this time of year when we can wish all of you a very Merry Christmas , Joyeux No ë l à tous . 
we also wish to extend our thanks to the pages . 
may Santa Claus be very good to you , but may those exams go even better . 
to the Table officers and to all of the staff , including the reporters , the translators , security personnel , messengers , and , indeed , the cleaning staff , who certainly have to deal with these overflowing wastepaper baskets that I certainly have here to my left tonight , we extend our heartfelt thanks . 
particularly at this time of year , I would like to thank the Committees Branch , because our best work in this chamber is indeed done in committees . 
it is done with their able , careful and thoughtful work . 
honourable senators , we have welcomed many new senators into this chamber in the past year , so this is the first time we have the opportunity to wish them a very Merry Christmas . 
i hope that their experiences here will be joyful because , frankly , it is a joyful experience to have them here . 
hon. Senators : 
hear , hear ! 
hon. Marcel Prud ' homme : 
honourable senators , on behalf of Senator Roche and myself I wish to join in the good wishes expressed by Senators Kinsella and Carstairs . 
we are tremendously well served . 
we do not pay enough attention to our staff , and I hope every senator will never forget to say " bonjour " to the staff . 
my very best wishes for the holiday season go out to all Canadians . 
i am going to make just one exception to that wish . 
senator Kinsella said - 
speaking for myself , honourable senators , unfortunately , my good wishes that I extend to all Canadians do not extend to Diane Francis , who saw fit today , in a vitriolic article , to reduce to almost nil every effort that some of us are making as good federalists , by attacking one of the most prominent entrepreneurial families . 
i am talking about the P é ladeau family . 
for those of you who may not know , the subject on the hotlines all over Quebec is this article . 
such a disgusting act at this time of year . 
while we here in the Senate are trying to build a stronger Canada , we are confront with this article that seeks to destroy those efforts . 
anyone who reads that article cannot but start hating whatever the young P é ladeau sons represent for us in Quebec . 
i regret that . 
it is causing irreparable damage . 
having said that , Canada is stronger than all these mocking writers , and I prefer , for the moment , to hold my tongue . 
we will come back to that later , for it is a debate which must be conducted in the Senate . 
to our new senators , I must offer my thanks for taking good care of the independent senators . 
to our Honourable Speaker , his wife , and his staff , I convey my best wishes for a very merry Christmas . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , if I may for a moment , I should like to add my thanks to those expressed so eloquently by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition , the Deputy Leader of the Government and Senator Prud ' homme . 
i want also like to convey my thanks to all of the staff who have worked so diligently for us throughout the year . 
i want to say a particular thanks to all of you who sit on either side . 
indeed , I want to pay special thanks to those who raise points of order . 
i find those very challenging and helpful in developing our history and our system of government . 
my best wishes to one and all for a very merry Christmas , a happy New Year , and may the coming year find us with the same cordial and hard - working Senate we have enjoyed this year . 
i am in the fortunate position of being able , I suppose , to make my thanks more tangible than the rest of you by inviting all of you to come to my chambers and meet the judge . 
i also invite the pages and all of the staff who work with us here in the Senate to join us in the Speaker ' s chamber on this last occasion when we will be together for this year .
