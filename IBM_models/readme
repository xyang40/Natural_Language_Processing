0. The codes have been written in Java.

1. Please use the following scripts to execute the programs:
a. For unigram model:
./unigram english-senate-0.txt english-senate-1.txt english-senate-2.txt good-bad.txt
b. For bigram model:
./bigram english-senate-0.txt english-senate-1.txt english-senate-2.txt good-bad.txt

2. I preprocess every sentence in the following way:
#START# SENTENCECONTENT #END#
Therefore the start and the end of sentences are treated as different symbols.
Also, the unknown symbol is denoted #UNBEKANNT#.
